TEXT: Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2020, %PLAYERNAME%! GO Fest this year is a little bit different from previous years, but that doesn't mean it'll be any less fun--or challenging!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: I’ve noticed an amazing phenomena, it seems as though different Pokémon are appearing in the area on what seems an hourly basis. I’m going to need your help collecting data on this situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_10
TEXT: We will have another fun filled day tomorrow, but for now I'm going to start looking into this situation as it is reminding me of a certain mythical Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_11
TEXT: Now, %PLAYERNAME%, I'm sure you know what I'm going to say next.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_12
TEXT: Let's GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: I thought it would be fun to tie this phenomena to some tasks for you to complete. If you are able to complete them, I’ll make sure you get a reward for your hard work!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: For more details, you can log into the Global Challenge Arena. Don’t delay, since these Pokémon seem to be rotating quickly, your time to complete the tasks are limited!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: To help with your tasks, be sure to equip a few Incense to attract Pokémon. You've worked hard to earn rewards during the weekly challenges and don’t want you to miss out!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_5
TEXT: Tip: you can now equip several at once and have your Incense attract Pokémon to you for hours! Plus, I think they smell amazing.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_6
TEXT: Playing wherever you are doesn't mean you're playing alone! It brings a smile to my face knowing that there are millions of Trainers around the world right now working together because we all share a love for Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_7
TEXT: Furthermore, I've been sensing a great energy that has filled me with hope and determination, have you been feeling it as well?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_8
TEXT: I wonder if it has any connection to the strange happenings that has kicked off our research this weekend.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_9

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, by the look on your face, I’m sure you’ve grasped the situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: Yes, that is Team GO Rocket confetti raining down from the sky. Yes, grunts are invading PokéStops all around the world. And yes...Team GO Rocket has taken over Pokémon GO Fest. And yes...I’m so glad you’re here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: We thought that when we defeated them and ended their takeover during the GO Fest Timed Research that that would be the end of them for the time being.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: It appears to have only been a part of a larger plan. What their ultimate end goal, though, is still to be determined. Regardless of what lies in wait, %PLAYERNAME%...you must prepare yourself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: I’ve been in contact with your fellow Trainers around the world and I’m impressed by your energy! As long as we work together, I know victory is within our reach!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Pokémon are battle-ready and I bet your fellow Trainers are thankful for the supplies you’ve sent their way. We need to work together to keep Team GO Rocket at bay and save Pokémon GO Fest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Oh, what’s this? Looks like the snapshots you took features some unwelcome guests! It's amazing that they're able to organize these massive takeovers, but they do seem a little silly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Is this actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don’t you go ahead and put all of that training to work? In the meantime, I’ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Looks like you’ve just caught a Golem for your hard work!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been scoping out the Team GO Rocket members traveling via balloon and have discovered that the Team GO Rocket leaders are using Flying-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Sources are telling me that they might have captured some Legendary Pokémon and turned them into Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: If I recall correctly, the team leaders saw one of these balloons at GO Fest last year and also during their takeover a few weeks ago.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t have imagined that they’d rally resources behind such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it’s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into equipping his grunts with balloons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: …Anyway, your Rock-type Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock! It’s time to rock their world, %PLAYERNAME%, and save those Shadow Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra. Now all that’s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Candela, Blanche, and Spark can handle the Team GO Rocket leaders from here while you prepare to face the boss. It's extremely interesting to see the Team GO Rocket Leaders commanding these Shadow Legendary Pokémon which are usually reserved for the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: I wonder what this means as we uncover more of their devious plans and what Pokémon he now has under his control.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: I was worried about them but I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that mysterious energy I was detecting yesterday?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: They and Trainers worldwide were suddenly overcome with a great energy that is filling them with hope and determination that they can win. I started digging through my research and found references to the very same energy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: It documents a Mythical Pokémon that shares infinite energy and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling this is why Team GO Rocket is here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: Perhaps they hope to use this powerful Pokémon to further their evil plans, since they’ve been so unsuccessful in the past?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pokémon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type moves. That Machamp that you caught earlier in your research might help you here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_8
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. The fate of Pokémon GO Fest is in your hands.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and he appears to be retreating! Who would have thought that he could even turn Mewtwo into a Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: It was a tough battle, but the fact that you defeated it really proves what an amazing Trainer you are. This alone is a mystery we need to investigate.

TEXT: Candela, Blanche, and Spark were victorious battling the Team GO Rocket leaders and I’m now receiving word that they are retreating as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Turns out the Mythical Pokémon that Team GO Rocket was after was Victini, the Victory Pokémon! They say that this Pokémon brings victory and that Trainers with Victini always win, regardless of the type of encounter.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: I am now sure that energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I’m in utter awe at your tenacity and determination. Pokémon GO Fest was saved thanks to your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_challenge#2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_challenge#3
TEXT: I’ll defeat you quickly so I can return to the take-over festivities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_defeat#1
TEXT: I was supposed to win! Everything went perfectly for our take-over!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_defeat#2
TEXT: This take-over was supposed to be my biggest event of the year. How dare you humiliate me like this!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_defeat#3

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_greeting#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_victory#2
TEXT: First we take over this big event, and now I win a battle? Best day ever!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_victory#3

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_challenge#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_defeat#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_defeat#2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_defeat#3
TEXT: You have only delayed the inevitable. I will win.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#2
TEXT: I’m impressed that you got by my leaders, Trainer, but nothing will prepare you for my Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#3
TEXT: At first, I was impressed by your dedication, but now you’ve become a nuisance. This festival is mine.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#1
TEXT: I hope you now understand how foolish challenging me was. You will never stop Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#2
TEXT: My incredible plan is going swimmingly. Move aside—this event is mine.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#3
TEXT: As expected. Run back to your professor—you still have much training to do.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_challenge#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#3

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#1
TEXT: This must be a mistake. Failure isn’t an option.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#2
TEXT: You must have some kind of special power on your side that made you win. That’s the only explanation...

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#3

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_greeting#1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. Something odd is happening, and I need your help investigating it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_1
TEXT: While I was on a walk last night with my Buddy Pokémon, Meltan, I noticed a strange light flickering in my mobile lab. It was so spooky! One might’ve called it...a ghastly sight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_2
TEXT: Apparently, some Gastly were in my mobile lab hiding from the wind. It’s common for them to take shelter when massive gusts are blowing about so their gaseous bodies aren’t blown away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_3
TEXT: However, the sheer number of Gastly seemed unusual. They’re still in the mobile lab, so could you help me look into this situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were helping with our research, I was assisting the Gastly in the mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_1
TEXT: I had to be careful when I got near the Gastly. I didn’t want to be engulfed by their gaseous bodies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_2
TEXT: Now that the Gastly are out of the mobile lab, I think it’s time for us to start looking into Gastly’s Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_3
TEXT: I’ve done some reading on the matter, and I think we’ll need to prepare for a dangerous Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Seems as though your Gastly has evolved into Haunter. I had a feeling I was being watched.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_1
TEXT: It’s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it’s just being playful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_2
TEXT: I’ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don’t think Blanche is amused.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s go ahead and fix that problem by evolving Haunter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer. Your Haunter has now become the Shadow Pokémon, Gengar! Are you ready for a spooky story? Let me get my flashlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_1
TEXT: If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_2
TEXT: Do you feel that chill in the air? That means a Gengar is near. OOOoooOOOooo...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_3
TEXT: BOO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_4
TEXT: Hahaha, got you, %PLAYERNAME%! I crack myself up. Although...it looked for a second like there was a ghostly hand on your shoulder... Maybe it was just my imagination.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pokémon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it’s a fantastic Pokémon to have on your team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks to your help, I think we all learned something today! I’ll be in touch when I have another adventure for you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1
TEXT: Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2
TEXT: ...Uh, moving along...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3
TEXT: Weedle’s horn measures about two inches. It’s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate Weedle further—but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to get poked by one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0
TEXT: Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research—Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1
TEXT: It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and—in my opinion—honkable nose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2
TEXT: I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don’t think to offer me any.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s Evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0
TEXT: Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1
TEXT: Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2
TEXT: And that’s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn’t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we’ve learned so much about what’s happening to Kakuna!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it’s been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0
TEXT: Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1
TEXT: Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2
TEXT: This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pokémon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn’t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab’s tires!
