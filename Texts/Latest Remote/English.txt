RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_1
TEXT: Not sure if you’ve noticed, but there seems to be a huge influx of Eevee, the Evolution Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_2
TEXT: Some theorize that the key to the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution lies within Eevee’s genetics.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_3
TEXT: I can understand that hypothesis—after all, Eevee can evolve into EIGHT Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_4
TEXT: I sure wish I were as adaptable as Eevee!

TEXT: I don’t even have eight different outfits. I basically wear this lab coat all the time—even to formal events!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_6

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_7
TEXT: I can’t wait to get started! Let’s GO learn about Eevee!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_0
TEXT: Great work with your research on Eevee, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_1
TEXT: According to my findings, Eevee’s irregular DNA gives it the ability to evolve into many different Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_2
TEXT: For example, it has three Evolutions originally discovered in the Kanto region: the Water-type Vaporeon, the Electric-type Jolteon, and the Fire-type Flareon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t it fascinating that Eevee can evolve into Pokémon of such different types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_4
TEXT: As you work on your Eevee research, perhaps you might learn more about these Pokémon. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve gotten a Vaporeon, a Jolteon, and a Flareon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_1
TEXT: These incredible creatures are capable of some impressive feats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_2
TEXT: Did you know that Vaporeon can melt away into water?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_3
TEXT: Or that Jolteon can blast out 10,000-volt lightning bolts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_4
TEXT: And that Flareon breathes fire that is over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t it amazing that all three of these Pokémon evolve from Eevee?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_6
TEXT: Perhaps there’s something besides genetics that gives Eevee so much potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_7
TEXT: Let’s do some more research to learn more about Eevee. At certain times of the day, this Pokémon can evolve into Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region: the Psychic-type Espeon and the Dark-type Umbreon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_8
TEXT: If you keep up your research, you might find them as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_0

TEXT: The Psychic-type Espeon can use the fine hair on its body to sense air currents and predict its enemies’ next move. It usually evolves from Eevee during the daytime.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_2
TEXT: As for the Dark-type Umbreon, it evolves from Eevee during the nighttime. It’s said that Umbreon’s rings glow yellow under the full moon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_3
TEXT: Who would’ve thought that something like the time of day could affect Pokémon Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_4
TEXT: It’s wonderful to delve even deeper into the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_5
TEXT: Let’s keep it up by researching Eevee’s Evolutions that were originally discovered in the Sinnoh region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_6
TEXT: The Grass-type Leafeon and Ice-type Glaceon seem to have evolved in order to adapt to their environment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_7
TEXT: Why don’t you research these Pokémon next?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, welcome back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_1
TEXT: I see you’ve managed to get a Leafeon and a Glaceon! Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_2
TEXT: The vastly different environments in the Sinnoh region appear to have caused the adaptable Eevee to evolve into a Grass-type Pokémon and an Ice-type Pokémon. It’s inspiring to see how resilient this little Pokémon can be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_3
TEXT: We might not uncover all the secrets of Pokémon Evolution today, but I think we can learn a lot about ourselves through Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_4
TEXT: Researching Eevee today has taught me there are so many paths in life to choose from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_5
TEXT: I hope that Eevee can inspire you to find the one that suits you best.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_6
TEXT: But enough of this professor’s ramblings. Eevee is known to have just one more Evolution—the Fairy-type Sylveon, which was originally discovered in the Kalos region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_7
TEXT: This Pokémon has ribbonlike feelers that it uses to calm others. Sylveon evolves from Eevee when it reaches a certain level of friendship and trust with its beloved Trainer. Knowing that almost brings a tear to my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_8
TEXT: I hope you have the good fortune of crossing paths with a wonderful Pokémon like Sylveon sometime soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_9
TEXT: Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I came across a truly surprising sight recently while going for a walk—trees in the nearby forest were covered with slash marks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_1
TEXT: I’ve heard of a Pokémon called Oshawott, the Sea Otter Pokémon, that can detach the scalchop on its stomach for use as a blade. Maybe the slash marks were caused by all of the Oshawott nearby?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_2
TEXT: Let's use this as an opportunity to go and catch some of those Oshwott so we can find out more!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_0
TEXT: Hey %PLAYERNAME%! Did you know that Oshawott doesn't just use the scalchop on its stomach to fight, but that it can be used to break open hard berries as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_1
TEXT: Maybe we can learn even more about Oshawott once it evolves into its next Evolution: Dewott! Don’t let its cute exterior fool you—Dewott takes itself very seriously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_2
TEXT: Also known as the Discipline Pokémon, this little fella uses strict training to learn its flowing double-scalchop technique. I’d love to see Dewott’s fighting in action!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_0
TEXT: Wow, Dewott's double-scalchop technique is amazing! Aren’t Pokémon so curious, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_1
TEXT: I barely have the coordination to rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time and we have creatures that have their own special battle techniques. Truly inspiring stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_2
TEXT: I’m starting to understand a bit more about this Pokémon now. And I have an inkling that we’ll get to learn even more soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_3
TEXT: It’s Evolution, Samurott, apparently uses swords incorporated in its armor called seamitars. Apparently in the time it takes a foe to blink, it can draw and sheathe the seamitars attached to its front legs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_4
TEXT: Sounds like it’s a true master of its craft! No wonder it’s known as the Formidable Pokémon! Let’s evolve Dewott and see this mastery for ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_0
TEXT: Well would you look at that, %PLAYERNAME%, a Samurott in the flesh! It’s seamitars truly are a sight to behold. Knowing it can draw and sheathe its blades in a blink of an eye, I wonder how fast it can dice up berries...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_1
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. We’ve learned so much about Oshawott, Dewott, and Samurott—and from them too! I’ll SEA you next time! Ha-ha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. A new adventure is about to begin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_1
TEXT: Not long ago, various Legendary Pokémon began emerging from mysterious rings that suddenly appeared in the sky. After some research, we discovered it was Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon, that was responsible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_2
TEXT: Hoopa’s rings allow it to teleport things—including itself—wherever it wants. That power makes it hard to track down, but for some reason, Hoopa seems to keep returning to this area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_3
TEXT: How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty bold, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_4
TEXT: Luckily, he and Candela managed to retrieve my spectacles by chasing down the rings that were popping up at random around my mobile lab. So, at least I can still see. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_5
TEXT: Needless to say, I’m still not sure why Hoopa’s here. Tracking it down has been difficult, but with your help, I’m sure we’ll crack the case in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_6
TEXT: For now, why don’t you try using an Incense to see what Pokémon you can find in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_0
TEXT: As with all great mysteries, solving this will take time, patience, and trust. I’ll need to work alone at some points, but I promise I’ll return to share my findings and help propel us forward.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_1
TEXT: You just keep exploring the world as you always do. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_2
TEXT: I’ll report back here once I have more information on Hoopa. Thanks in advance for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1
TEXT: I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche!
