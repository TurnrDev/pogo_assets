RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you and your fellow Trainers have been taking care of yourselves. Remember to take a break every now and then to do something you really enjoy! I like to go on short walks, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_1
TEXT: In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pokémon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_2
TEXT: Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_3
TEXT: Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn’t the first time I’ve witnessed such a gathering...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_4
TEXT: Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_2
TEXT: For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pokémon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_3
TEXT: Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_4
TEXT: Charmander’s evolved form is Charmeleon—but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_0
TEXT: That’s a fine Charmeleon you’ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_1
TEXT: Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_2
TEXT: When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_3
TEXT: The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_4
TEXT: Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pokémon! Come back and see me once you’ve evolved your Charmeleon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pokémon Charizard!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_1
TEXT: Charizard is a truly amazing Pokémon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_2
TEXT: While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_3
TEXT: What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_4
TEXT: They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_0
TEXT: I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_1
TEXT: Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_2
TEXT: Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_3
TEXT: It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_4
TEXT: Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_5
TEXT: Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_6
TEXT: Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages around my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing the problem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_2
TEXT: It didn't take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the energy used to power my mobile lab up and running would make a much better snack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_3
TEXT: They seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4
TEXT: Do you think you’d be able to help catch some Electabuzz?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_5
TEXT: The research would be very valuable and I would be very grateful to have my power restored!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for the assistance, I really appreciate it! While you were out catching all those Electabuzz, I did some research on this family of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_2
TEXT: Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid, the Electric Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_3
TEXT: A weak electric current flows between its horns. Be careful, Trainer, sticking a hand between its horns will actually shock you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_4
TEXT: Hmm… I wonder if Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon…

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5
TEXT: Anyway, let’s keep looking into this unusual situation with Electabuzz and make sure it isn’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity, explaining why it was attracted to my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2
TEXT: Electricity runs across the surface of its body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish-blue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3
TEXT: Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research and go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz to Electivire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_4
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what the electrifying conclusion is to our research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_0
TEXT: I just don’t ever know if they find my jokes funny… should I take a comedy class?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_1
TEXT: OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you've evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2
TEXT: Looking at the Pokédex, it says as its electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3
TEXT: When in battle, it pushes the tips of its two tails against the foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_4
TEXT: Be sure to take your time and learn more about this Pokémon before adding it to your battle team, that is a lot of power you are dealing with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5
TEXT: With the lights back on in the mobile lab I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6
TEXT: Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0
TEXT: BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1
TEXT: Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2
TEXT: Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3
TEXT: Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4
TEXT: Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5
TEXT: Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6
TEXT: Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0
TEXT: Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1
TEXT: What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2
TEXT: Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3
TEXT: After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4
TEXT: The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5
TEXT: Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0
TEXT: Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2
TEXT: I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3
TEXT: There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4
TEXT: One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6
TEXT: I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0
TEXT: Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_1
TEXT: Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2
TEXT: Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3
TEXT: All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4
TEXT: Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5
TEXT: I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_1
TEXT: Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_5
TEXT: I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_2
TEXT: As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_1
TEXT: However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_2
TEXT: Keep your eyes open, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_1
TEXT: What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_2
TEXT: We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_3
TEXT: What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_1
TEXT: As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_2
TEXT: We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_3
TEXT: More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_0
TEXT: Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_1
TEXT: I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_2
TEXT: While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_3
TEXT: It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1
TEXT: While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_2
TEXT: It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_3
TEXT: First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_4
TEXT: This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1
TEXT: I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2
TEXT: You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_3
TEXT: You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_0
TEXT: Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1
TEXT: Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_2
TEXT: This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!
