RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2020, %PLAYERNAME%! GO Fest this year is a little bit different from previous years, but it’ll be just as fun—and challenging!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: I’ve noticed an amazing phenomenon—it seems as though different Pokémon are appearing in the area on what seems an hourly basis. I need your help collecting data on this situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_10
TEXT: We’ll have another fun-filled day tomorrow. For now, I’m going to start looking into this situation. Perhaps it’s related to a powerful Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_11
TEXT: Now, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m sure you know what I’m going to say next.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_12
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: I thought it would be fun to give you some tasks to help you research this phenomenon. I’ll make sure you get a reward for your hard work!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: Don’t delay—since different Pokémon seem to be appearing each hour, you have limited time to complete these tasks! You can see Trainers’ progress by checking the Global Challenge Arena.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: To help with your research, be sure to use Incense to attract Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_5
TEXT: Remember, you can now activate several Incense at once and have them attract Pokémon to you for hours! Incense smells amazing, doesn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_6
TEXT: It brings a smile to my face knowing that millions of Trainers around the world are working together right now because of their shared love of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_7
TEXT: Furthermore, I’ve been sensing a great energy that has filled me with hope and determination. Have you been feeling it as well?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_8
TEXT: I wonder whether it’s connected to the strange happenings that kicked off our research this weekend.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_9
TEXT: I have a feeling today’s just the beginning of an exciting adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_title
TEXT: GO Fest 2020: Welcome!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_title_0
TEXT: GO Fest 2020: Welcome! (1/1)

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, by the look on your face, I’m sure you’ve grasped the situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket confetti is raining down from the sky. Grunts are invading PokéStops all around the world. And...Team GO Rocket has taken over Pokémon GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: We thought we put a stop to them when we ended their take-over during our research leading up to GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: But that take-over appears to have been only part of a larger plan. We have yet to determine Team GO Rocket’s ultimate goal, though. Regardless of what it is, %PLAYERNAME%...you must prepare yourself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: I’m impressed by your energy and that of your fellow Trainers around the world! If we work together, I know victory is within our reach!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Pokémon are ready for battle, and I bet your fellow Trainers are thankful for the supplies you’ve sent their way. We’ll need to work together to keep Team GO Rocket at bay and save Pokémon GO Fest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Oh, what’s this? Looks like the snapshots you took feature some unwelcome guests! It’s amazing that Team GO Rocket can organize these massive take-overs, but its members do seem a little silly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe these photobombs are actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don’t you put all your training to use? In the meantime, I’ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, you’ve caught a Golem!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been scoping out the Team GO Rocket balloons and have discovered that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are using Flying-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Sources told me that Team GO Rocket might’ve captured some Legendary Pokémon and turned them into Shadow Pokémon, too!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: If I recall correctly, the team leaders saw one of these balloons at GO Fest last year—and another during the Team GO Rocket take-over a few weeks ago.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t have imagined that Team GO Rocket would spend resources on such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it’s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into providing his Grunts with balloons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to rock Team GO Rocket’s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo. Now all that’s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela can handle the Team GO Rocket Leaders while you prepare to face the boss. It’s interesting that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are commanding these Legendary Shadow Pokémon, which are usually reserved for the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll learn what this means as we uncover Team GO Rocket’s devious plans and discover what Pokémon Giovanni now has under his control.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: On the bright side, I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that powerful energy I detected yesterday?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: The team leaders reported that Trainers worldwide suddenly felt a similar energy that filled them with hope and determination. Through my research, I found references to that very same energy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: They document a Mythical Pokémon that shares its infinite energy with others and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling that’s why Team GO Rocket is here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: Perhaps Team GO Rocket hopes to further its dastardly plans by using this powerful Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pokémon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type attacks. The Machamp you caught earlier might help you here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_8
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. The fate of Pokémon GO Fest is in your hands.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and sent him packing! Who would’ve thought that he could turn even Mewtwo into a Shadow Pokémon? That alone is a mystery we need to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: It was a tough battle, and the fact that you defeated Mewtwo proves what an amazing Trainer you are.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela were victorious against the Team GO Rocket Leaders and drove them away, too.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: Thanks to everyone’s efforts, we’ve saved Pokémon GO Fest! It’s time to celebrate!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Turns out, Team GO Rocket was after Victini, the Victory Pokémon! Some say this Pokémon brings victory to its Trainer, regardless of the contest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: I’m now sure that the energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I’m in utter awe of your tenacity and determination. Pokémon GO Fest was saved because of your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Phew! Now, I think we should get back to having fun. There’s still time to enjoy the festivities!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: While this year’s GO Fest was quite a bit different from previous ones, I’m overjoyed that Trainers all over the world could still come together to celebrate—and protect—our beloved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: Even when we’re apart, we’re still united by our love of Pokémon. No matter what obstacles appear in your path, you can always count on your Pokémon and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: I know we’ll all meet again under the same sky someday, so until then...let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_victory#1
TEXT: Look at me—I want to take a picture of this moment so I can revel in your disappointment later.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_victory#2
TEXT: If only Candela could see me now. We’ve taken over your celebration, and now I’ve defeated you!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_arlo_victory#3
TEXT: Isn’t this confetti beautiful?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_challenge#1
TEXT: I bet the boss is so proud of us for taking over this event! Don’t take this from us—I need this.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_challenge#2
TEXT: We’ve already taken over this event—now it’s time for the muscle to take you down!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_challenge#3
TEXT: Let’s finish this quick so I can join the other leaders and celebrate the take-over!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_defeat#1
TEXT: NO! We can’t lose our Team GO Rocket festival—we’ve come so far!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_defeat#2
TEXT: What just happened? Are we going to lose the event?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_defeat#3
TEXT: I can’t believe I failed the team.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_greeting#1
TEXT: Enjoying your little festival? Well, it’s a Team GO Rocket festival now!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_greeting#2
TEXT: Hahaha! I’m in a good mood today. This event is ours!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_greeting#3
TEXT: Team GO Rocket has come so far. We’ve finally taken over your big celebration!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_victory#1
TEXT: Hahaha, what a great battle! Happy Team GO Rocket festival! Time to celebrate with my Grunts!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_victory#2
TEXT: First we take over this big event, and now I win a battle? Best day ever!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_cliff_victory#3
TEXT: Winning a battle is a great feeling. It’s even better after a take-over!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_challenge#1
TEXT: I do not think you are prepared for the level of failure you are about to experience!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_challenge#2
TEXT: You should be afraid to battle me, especially since you are already too late to stop my take-over!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_challenge#3
TEXT: You will regret trying to put a dent in my perfectly executed take-over. Your Pokémon will be mine!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_defeat#1
TEXT: This is not the end. I will have my revenge.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_defeat#2
TEXT: This festival will be mine one day. You will see—this is not over.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_defeat#3
TEXT: You have only delayed the inevitable. I will win.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#1
TEXT: I’m surprised you’ve been this successful, considering the foolish guidance your pathetic professor has given you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#2
TEXT: I’m impressed that you got by my leaders, Trainer, but nothing will prepare you for my Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#3
TEXT: At first, I was impressed by your dedication, but now you’ve become a nuisance. This festival is mine.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#1
TEXT: I hope you now understand how foolish challenging me was. You will never stop Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#2
TEXT: My incredible plan is going swimmingly. Move aside—this event is mine.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#3
TEXT: As expected. Run back to your professor—you still have much training to do.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_challenge#1
TEXT: Sure glad I got over that fear of heights... Oh, wait... What?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_challenge#2
TEXT: I’ve always wanted to see this event from the air! What a view!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_challenge#3
TEXT: Where do you think the boss got all these balloons?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_combat#1
TEXT: Talk about getting the high ground! Eh? Eh?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_combat#2
TEXT: I know I talked about moving up in the organization...but I didn’t think that would mean flying in a balloon...

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_combat#3
TEXT: Do you think there are any of those Pikachu visors left? I’d like to get one as a souvenir of the take-over.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_defeat#1
TEXT: Caw, caw... Worst event ever...

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_defeat#2
TEXT: Get in a balloon, they said. It’ll be fun, they said. This is the worst event ever...

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_defeat#3
TEXT: This confetti just makes me sad now. Worst event ever.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_greeting#1
TEXT: Caw, CAW! We’ve already taken the skies, and now we’ve taken your precious event, too!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_greeting#2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket’s balloon squad, reporting for duty! We’ve taken over this festival!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_greeting#3
TEXT: Wow! The confetti looks great from up here!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_victory#1
TEXT: Today, this celebration. Tomorrow, the world!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_victory#2
TEXT: I know you hate to see us take over your festival but love to watch us fly away.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_victory#3
TEXT: Can’t wait to fly around in my handy-dandy hot-air balloon and defeat other event attendees!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#1
TEXT: I didn’t even need to be here for this take-over. Just to make it worth my time, let’s battle.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#2
TEXT: I know I’ll be disappointed in your battling, so let’s just get this over with.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#3
TEXT: Might as well pass the time with a battle, considering your little event is ruined.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#1
TEXT: This must be a mistake. Failure isn’t an option.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#2
TEXT: You must have some kind of special power on your side that made you win. That’s the only explanation...

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#3
TEXT: I can’t believe I lost to such an unworthy opponent! You’ll pay for disrupting our plans!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_greeting#1
TEXT: It’s almost silly that I’m here, considering we already took over this event.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_greeting#2
TEXT: Aww, you think the confetti is for you... Sorry, darling, it’s for our flawless victory.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_greeting#3
TEXT: You’ve already had your fun. This year, your little festival is ours!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_victory#1
TEXT: Oh surprise, surprise—I won. I wouldn’t expect anything less.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_victory#2
TEXT: See? Wasn’t that a silly waste of time? This celebration is ours!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_victory#3
TEXT: I’m sorry, darling—you lost. I’m afraid I can’t relate. I don’t know what losing feels like.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Do you hear that sound?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_1
TEXT: All morning, I’ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it’s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_2
TEXT: Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_3
TEXT: Guess it’s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_4
TEXT: Anyway, I think it’ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they’re harmless.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_5
TEXT: However, I see potential in this Pokémon. It’s time to head out and investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that’s something I’d like to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_2
TEXT: Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pokémon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_3
TEXT: I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don’t you think? Let’s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_4
TEXT: Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they’re quite useful as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_0
TEXT: Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you’ve completed, it’s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_1
TEXT: Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn’t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_3
TEXT: So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type—something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_4
TEXT: Looks like you’ll be adding a powerful Pokémon to your team, but let’s proceed with caution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you’ve got yourself a Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_1
TEXT: I’m sure this Pokémon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_2
TEXT: Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_3
TEXT: I’m excited to see what kinds of challenges you’ll demolish together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_4
TEXT: Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles—not entire cities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, until next time!
