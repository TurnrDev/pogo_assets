RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. As you know, I do a lot of research. There are just so many Pokémon to learn about and document!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Recently, I’ve been investigating Ralts, the Feeling Pokémon, to learn more about how this Pokémon senses people’s emotions by using the horns on its head.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: It’s an amazing ability, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I thought studying this Pokémon’s unique sensing powers could help me identify the strange feeling that’s been stirring inside me these past few weeks.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I’ve realized, though, that this isn’t any ordinary emotion—it’s a type of energy!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: This mysterious energy is filling me with hope and determination. I feel like I could take on any challenge and be victorious!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_6
TEXT: I would appreciate your assistance in collecting more information on this strange and fascinating phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing the research we needed to get started, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: While you were catching Pokémon and visiting PokéStops, I started digging through my research and found references to a phenomenon that seems to have a lot in common with what I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: The reports refer to a Mythical Pokémon that shares the infinite energy it creates with others to guarantee victory.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: The reports also state that this Pokémon is Psychic- and Fire-type. What an amazing combination!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: To get closer to confirming the source of the energy, let’s focus our efforts on catching Pokémon that share those same types.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts researching Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, we’re well on our way to confirming the source of this mysterious energy.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: There’s many a mystery surrounding our path forward, so I’ll keep poring over our research notes. In the meantime, I’d like you to work on becoming better friends with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: As a Trainer, strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon is an important task that requires a specific set of skills.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: To further develop those skills, why don’t you try spending time with your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Successful partnerships take work and dedication, and talented Trainers build lifelong friendships with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: That being said, be sure to spend time with your buddy every day!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: You have a wonderful bond with your buddy, Trainer! It’s been a treat watching that friendship bloom. Now, though, it’s time to focus our efforts on the matter at hand!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: After further examination of the research you completed, I’m convinced that the Pokémon we’re looking for is Victini, the Victory Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only would this be consistent with the references to a Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, but it would also explain the mysterious surge of energy I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: It’s time for you to befriend Victini. Since this Pokémon represents victory, I think winning a few battles might inspire it to come forward!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: I’ve been hearing reports that Team GO Rocket is causing trouble. Battling these troublemakers just might show this Pokémon you’re worthy of attention!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Let’s see whether some victory will attract the Victory Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Absolutely astounding, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d be able to display your powerful bonds and battle prowess to impress the Mythical Pokémon Victini.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: It shares the infinite energy it creates when its body overflows with power, so I’m absolutely certain now that the energy I was feeling was coming directly from Victini!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: Be sure to use this power wisely, %PLAYERNAME%, as you and Victini take on new challenges. But for now, your hard work calls for a celebration!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: Why don’t you take a few snapshots with Victini and share your success with fellow Trainers by sending them some Gifts?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_0
TEXT: Once again, you have helped me uncover a huge discovery. I cannot thank you enough for your time and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is filled with endless discoveries, and it isn’t every day we come across a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: I hope that you will take the lessons we learned together through this investigation and apply them to your training.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: I’m proud of you, %PLAYERNAME%, and hope you continue to strive to be your very best. Until next time, let’s GO!

TEXT: We’re going to focus our efforts on Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pokémon I’ve never seen before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_3
TEXT: First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_1
TEXT: A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_1
TEXT: I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we’ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_2
TEXT: If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pokémon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I’ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_1
TEXT: It says that when the Mythical Pokémon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_1
TEXT: In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pokémon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_2
TEXT: Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_3
TEXT: Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn’t the first time I’ve witnessed such a gathering...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_4
TEXT: Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_2
TEXT: For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pokémon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_3
TEXT: Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_4
TEXT: Charmander’s evolved form is Charmeleon—but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_0
TEXT: That’s a fine Charmeleon you’ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_1
TEXT: Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_2
TEXT: When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_3
TEXT: The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_4
TEXT: Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pokémon! Come back and see me once you’ve evolved your Charmeleon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pokémon Charizard!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_1
TEXT: Charizard is a truly amazing Pokémon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_2
TEXT: While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_3
TEXT: What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_4
TEXT: They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_0
TEXT: I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_1
TEXT: Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_2
TEXT: Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_3
TEXT: It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_4
TEXT: Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_5
TEXT: Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_6
TEXT: Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1
TEXT: Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2
TEXT: After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.

TEXT: It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4
TEXT: I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5
TEXT: After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6
TEXT: It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7
TEXT: Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1
TEXT: Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2
TEXT: My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3
TEXT: It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4
TEXT: It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5
TEXT: Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6
TEXT: Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0
TEXT: Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1
TEXT: I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2
TEXT: While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3
TEXT: Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4
TEXT: Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6
TEXT: I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0
TEXT: I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1
TEXT: I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2
TEXT: I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4
TEXT: I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5
TEXT: In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_6
TEXT: However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_7
TEXT: You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again! I’m always grateful to have a helping hand with my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_1
TEXT: Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_2
TEXT: Well, I’m not entirely sure why, but Porygon have been appearing more frequently in the area as of late!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_3
TEXT: I’d like to take this opportunity to learn more about this odd Pokémon. How about it, Trainer? Will you go out and catch some Porygon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_1
TEXT: I was able to review the data you collected, and I discovered that Porygon is made entirely of programming code!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_2
TEXT: Other reports I dug up mention that it was created by a group of scientists using state-of-the-art technology. Can you believe it? A man-made Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_3
TEXT: Porygon have made a name for themselves by protecting cyberspace from suspicious activity! For something artificial, they sure do seem caring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_4
TEXT: Maybe I should keep a Porygon around in case Team GO Rocket tries a digital take-over...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_5
TEXT: Well, in the meantime, I’d like to learn more about Porygon’s evolved form, Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_6
TEXT: I have a hunch that you’ll need to use an Upgrade to evolve Porygon. Let's get back out there and see if we can't find one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts, I’ve realized just how different Porygon2 is from Porygon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_2
TEXT: According to my findings, further research and the implementation of artificial intelligence into its code allowed Porygon2 to develop the ability to learn independent of its programming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_3
TEXT: The power of science is just astounding, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_4
TEXT: These reports also mention that Porygon2 was upgraded to enable extraterrestrial exploration and planetary development, though it has yet to accomplish much.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_5
TEXT: I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_6
TEXT: For your next batch of research, I want you to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z using a Sinnoh Stone. Good luck out there, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats on evolving your Porygon2 into a Porygon-Z, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_1
TEXT: I’ve uncovered some notes about this Pokémon that I thought you’d find interesting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_2
TEXT: According to reports, an update was added to Porygon-Z’s programming that was supposed to allow it to move between dimensions. But the upgrade also caused Porygon-Z to become unstable, and it began behaving erratically.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_3
TEXT: Because the update caused instability, academics can’t seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_4
TEXT: It’s going to take a bit of time to file away all this research, but I’m thrilled we were able to learn more about Porygon and its Evolutions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_5
TEXT: Your hard work is always appreciated, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I’m in need of another inquisitive eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_6
TEXT: Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_2
TEXT: As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_1
TEXT: However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_2
TEXT: Keep your eyes open, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_1
TEXT: What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_2
TEXT: We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_3
TEXT: What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_1
TEXT: As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_2
TEXT: We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_3
TEXT: More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_0
TEXT: Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_1
TEXT: I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_2
TEXT: While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_3
TEXT: It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1
TEXT: While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_2
TEXT: It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_3
TEXT: First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_4
TEXT: This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1
TEXT: I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2
TEXT: You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_3
TEXT: You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_0
TEXT: Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1
TEXT: Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_2
TEXT: This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!
