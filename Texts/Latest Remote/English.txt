"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5", "One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.",

"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3", "Apparently, when this Pok\u00e9mon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s holding.",

"quest_special_dialogue_at_0_1", "Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra\u2019s ability to teleport.",
"quest_special_dialogue_at_0_2", "When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it\u2019s made copies of itself.",
"quest_special_dialogue_at_0_3", "However, what\u2019s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let\u2019s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pok\u00e9mon!",

"quest_special_dialogue_at_1_1", "It\u2019s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.",

"quest_special_dialogue_at_1_3", "I\u2019ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I\u2019ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?",

"quest_special_dialogue_at_2_2", "Why don\u2019t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I\u2019ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I\u2019ve developed.",
"quest_special_dialogue_at_2_3", "While it won\u2019t give you Abra\u2019s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.",
"quest_special_dialogue_at_3_0", "Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.",
"quest_special_dialogue_at_3_1", "We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!",
"quest_special_dialogue_at_3_2", "Pok\u00e9mon are truly amazing creatures. There\u2019s always something to discover.",

"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_2", "Team GO Rocket won\u2019t be going away anytime soon, so I\u2019m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_3", "While you\u2019ve done an amazing job so far, I\u2019m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_4", "The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn\u2019t be a good Professor if I didn\u2019t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_1", "Even though we\u2019ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I\u2019m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pok\u00e9mon keep appearing.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_2", "It seems even more Pok\u00e9mon are being turned into Shadow Pok\u00e9mon despite our efforts. I\u2019ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_0", "Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_1", "I\u2019m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_2", "Your talent has made it clear that you\u2019re ready for the next step in your preparations.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_3", "Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you\u2019re at your best!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_0", "All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_1", "Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I\u2019m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_2", "Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they\u2019re holed up!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete\u2014you\u2019re ready to take on Giovanni.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_1", "It\u2019s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_2", "You\u2019ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_3", "Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won\u2019t be able to stop you!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_0", "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You\u2019ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_1", "Although your battle with Giovanni wasn\u2019t easy, the skills you\u2019ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_2", "But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_3", "Giovanni doesn\u2019t like to lose, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back soon to further his plans.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_4", "I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I\u2019ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_0", "Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You\u2019ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I\u2019ve given you.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_1", "Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_2", "But there are so many aspects to Pok\u00e9mon training! I think it\u2019s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pok\u00e9mon Eggs.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_3", "Why not take a walk with your buddy Pok\u00e9mon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_4", "And be sure to rescue Shadow Pok\u00e9mon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pok\u00e9mon still need our help!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_0", "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_1", "I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pok\u00e9mon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche\u2019s research.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_2", "Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they\u2019re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pok\u00e9mon in danger.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_3", "While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_4", "I\u2019m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won\u2019t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket\u2019s leaders.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_0", "Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_1", "I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_2", "Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes! ",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_3", "Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_0", "You\u2019ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_1", "You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.",
