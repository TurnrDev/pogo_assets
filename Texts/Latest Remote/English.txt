RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_2
TEXT: It didn’t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab’s electricity would make an excellent snack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_3
TEXT: Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4
TEXT: Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_5
TEXT: The research would be valuable, and I’d be grateful to have my power restored!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_2
TEXT: Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_3
TEXT: A weak electric current flows between Elekid’s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_4
TEXT: Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5
TEXT: Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2
TEXT: Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3
TEXT: Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_4
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what electrifying facts we’ll learn about that Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_0
TEXT: I just don’t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_1
TEXT: OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2
TEXT: According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3
TEXT: When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_4
TEXT: Be careful with this Pokémon when battling with it—that’s a lot of power you’re dealing with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5
TEXT: With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6
TEXT: Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Can I just say how impressed I am with your progress as a Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_1
TEXT: You’ve really put in the time and effort to become one of the very best. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_2
TEXT: Say, do you remember when we first met? You were just a beginner back then, and I sent you off to catch your very first Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_3
TEXT: And look at you now! I’m glad we can share that memory together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_4
TEXT: Now, I’m sure an elite Trainer like yourself has mastered the art of catching Pokémon, but it’s important to keep your skills sharp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_5
TEXT: How about you head out and catch some Pokémon? I’ve assigned some tasks that should challenge even a Trainer of your caliber.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_6
TEXT: Good luck—and have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_0
TEXT: Great work as always, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_1
TEXT: I’m sure those tasks were a breeze for someone with your skills, but they were just a warm-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_2
TEXT: These next tasks should prove a bit more challenging.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_3
TEXT: I’m sure you’ve built special bonds with several Pokémon over the course of your adventures. You might even have a few Pokémon that you like to always bring into battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_4
TEXT: I’d like to see how powerful those bonds are. Why don’t you head out, challenge a few Team GO Rocket Grunts, and battle in some raids?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_5
TEXT: After all, the best Trainers never stop training!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_6
TEXT: Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_0
TEXT: How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_1
TEXT: I’m sure you had a great time working with your closest Pokémon companions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_2
TEXT: It’s always fascinating to see how Trainers and Pokémon work together, and I can tell that you take a lot of pride in training your team. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_3
TEXT: Say, why don’t you evolve some of the Pokémon you’ve caught so they can reach their full potential? You might even discover some new options for battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_4
TEXT: Enough about that, though—back to our research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_5
TEXT: This next batch will test your Pokémon-catching skills again, but with a twist. Or perhaps I should say a curve? Haha! That’s right—you’ll need to test your skills with Curveball Throws!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_6
TEXT: Make sure to stretch your throwing arm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_0
TEXT: Nice work, Trainer! I can tell you put a lot of effort into that research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_1
TEXT: I have Blanche assisting me with the analysis and care of all those Pokémon you sent over. It’s an impressive display of your progress, Trainer, and it’s caught Blanche’s eye as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_2
TEXT: Anyway, I should probably get back to work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_3
TEXT: But before I go, I want to say how nice it was to reminisce about our first memories as professor and Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_4
TEXT: I’m truly proud of you and how much you’ve grown!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_5
TEXT: I know you’re far from finished on that front, too, so I’ll be watching closely as you progress and checking in whenever I have more challenges for you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_6
TEXT: Until then, %PLAYERNAME%...let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wanted to check in on your progress. It looks like you’ve grown even more as a Trainer since we last spoke!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_1
TEXT: As for me, I’ve been spending a lot of time with my Buddy Pokémon lately, and it’s helped me think of some new research opportunities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_2
TEXT: Do you remember your first Buddy Pokémon? I remember mine—it was the mysterious Hex Nut Pokémon Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_3
TEXT: I still remember the day it earned its very own Best Buddy ribbon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_4
TEXT: That’s a proud moment in any Trainer’s journey, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_5
TEXT: Meltan and I have been around the block a few times, but I still look forward to the next PokéStop we’ll visit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_6
TEXT: Why don’t you and your buddy go out and visit some of your favorite places together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_0
TEXT: Hope you enjoyed a few walks together with your buddy, Trainer. Did you come across any interesting PokéStops?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_1
TEXT: I was inspired to head outdoors myself. I joined Spark and his buddy for a long walk after he won a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_2
TEXT: I even took a celebratory snapshot to mark the occasion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_3
TEXT: Going on walks together can be a great way to strengthen your bond with your Pokémon. It’s also a wonderful form of exercise!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_4
TEXT: Seeing the bond Spark shares with his Pokémon gave me some ideas for more research. Oh, and Spark also wanted me to let you know that he’s cheering you on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_5
TEXT: How about you and your buddy go out for a walk, challenge another Trainer and their Pokémon to battle, and take a few snapshots to capture some fun moments together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_6
TEXT: Working hard is important, but so is savoring the memories made along the way! Have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_0
TEXT: Did you make any fun memories with your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_1
TEXT: I’m always amazed by the variety in the snapshots taken by Trainers from all over the world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_2
TEXT: I’m especially fond of ones that capture surprise encounters with Pokémon like Smeargle!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_3
TEXT: That’s one of the best parts of taking snapshots—you never know what you’re going to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_4
TEXT: Hmm... That reminds me of when Team GO Rocket decided to start showing up in Trainers’ snapshots uninvited. And THAT reminds me of some more research I need your help with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_5
TEXT: To start, why don’t you and your buddy get warmed up with some raids? When you’re ready, I think we’ll need some help clearing out the Team GO Rocket Leaders in the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_6
TEXT: They’re always up to something, so it’s good to keep an eye out in case they try to take over any nearby PokéStops. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_1
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders are a challenge for most Trainers, but I knew they wouldn’t stand a chance against you and your Buddy Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_2
TEXT: The power of friendship is strong indeed—and just one of many benefits to building relationships with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_3
TEXT: The trust between a Trainer and their Pokémon is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Make sure to cherish it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_4
TEXT: I’m glad I was able to check in on your progress, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_5
TEXT: I’ll be back with more fun challenges as you continue your journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_6
TEXT: Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_1
TEXT: I can see you’ve been working as hard as ever!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_2
TEXT: We’ve been doing a lot of reminiscing lately, haven’t we? I think it’s important to look back on your accomplishments from time to time—especially when you’ve accomplished so much!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_3
TEXT: A major moment for many Trainers is their first victory in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_4
TEXT: It’s an unforgettable thrill that comes with a swell of pride for the Pokémon that sealed the victory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_5
TEXT: How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m sure you’ve got some epic battle stories to share with your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_6
TEXT: I’d like to focus on your battling skills for this next challenge. So to prepare, why don’t you get your team sorted and get in some throwing practice?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_0
TEXT: You clearly have some powerful Pokémon, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_1
TEXT: You’ve done an amazing job training them! I wanted to see how your battling skills have progressed, so I consulted with Candela to get her thoughts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_2
TEXT: I’m happy to report that she’s just as proud of you as I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_3
TEXT: For this next challenge, she suggested taking on some of her most difficult opponents—Team GO Rocket and its leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders can be intimidating, so Candela asked me to pass along some extra guidance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_5
TEXT: She said that when it comes to battling, you should take on your opponents with a cool head, strong Pokémon, and a heart full of passion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_6
TEXT: With that in mind, I think it’s time for you head out and put your skills to the test!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your battling skills are even more impressive than the last time we talked.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_1
TEXT: Those skills are vital not only when you take on Team GO Rocket but also when you battle in raids. Do you remember your first raid, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_2
TEXT: To me, there’s something special about a group of Trainers coming together to challenge a raid with their partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_3
TEXT: There’s no questioning the importance of the bonds Trainers share with their Pokémon, but I think the bonds Trainers share with their peers are equally important.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_4
TEXT: No matter your skill level, what team you’re on, or the Pokémon you bring to battle, raids are about each Trainer working together to achieve a common goal. And that’s what the Trainer community is all about!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_5
TEXT: I hope that inspired you to head out and challenge some raids with your fellow Trainers—because that’s part of your next task!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_6
TEXT: It should be a fun challenge, so be sure to give it your best shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_1
TEXT: Did you enjoy spending time with your fellow Trainers as you completed your tasks?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_2
TEXT: Hopefully you even found a Pokémon that’ll make a great addition to your team!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_3
TEXT: I hope you continue making memories with Trainers from all over as you work together and explore this amazing world filled with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_4
TEXT: Very few Trainers have made it as far as you have. Be sure to take a moment to celebrate your progress.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_5
TEXT: And remember—the journey is just as important as the destination!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_6
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_0
TEXT: I knew I’d see you here before long, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_1
TEXT: But before we begin this challenge, let’s take a couple deep breaths together, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_2
TEXT: In... And out... One more time. In... And out... There, that’s better.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_3
TEXT: A few deep breaths go a long way when you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand—and you’ll need plenty of focus for what I’ll be throwing your way next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_4
TEXT: Get it? “Throwing”? Ahem! Anyway... The sign of a truly great Trainer is their dedication to training, and true dedication takes time to prove.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_5
TEXT: Your next few tasks will take some time to complete, but don’t worry. Start with a deep breath, and be sure to enjoy yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_6
TEXT: Training can be hard work, but don’t forget it’s supposed to be fun, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_0
TEXT: Impressive work, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_1
TEXT: I don’t know many who would have the dedication and patience to complete those tasks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_2
TEXT: Say, I was just thinking... Do you remember when you decided which team you wanted to join?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_3
TEXT: Trainers often form a strong connection to their team and become dedicated members. Others, however, eventually look to change teams in hopes of gaining a different perspective and a fresh challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_4
TEXT: Everyone’s path is different, and I’ll always encourage you to find your own. There’s much to be learned from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, and Team Valor. Each team has its own unique characteristics and focus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_5
TEXT: I urge you to learn from your fellow Trainers and respect their paths. It’s sure to help you become a better Trainer! After all, only when we understand others can we truly understand ourselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_6
TEXT: Now, back to your research. I have a feeling this next batch will truly test your resolve, so take your time—we’ll regroup when you’re finished!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. You certainly showed your dedication by completing those tasks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_1
TEXT: Which did you find most difficult? And which was most fun?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_2
TEXT: We’re approaching the end of this challenge, and I’m not ashamed to say it’s making me a bit emotional! The team leaders and I feel an immense sense of pride when we see how much you’ve grown.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_3
TEXT: I hope you feel that pride in yourself, %PLAYERNAME%. To wrap up this challenge, each team leader wanted you to experience some of their most beloved activities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_4
TEXT: Spark wants you to enjoy a walk with your buddy to enhance your bond, and Blanche hopes to remind you of the importance of research and analysis by asking you to evolve some of your Pokémon to their full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_5
TEXT: As for Candela... Well, she wants to celebrate with you after you win some raids.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_6
TEXT: I think these are great tasks for a well-rounded Trainer like yourself. I’ll be here to congratulate you when you’re done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_0
TEXT: Amazing. Simply amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! Let me be the first to congratulate you for completing this challenge. You’ve become a truly top-class Trainer, and it’s been an honor to work alongside you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_1
TEXT: It’s been astonishing to witness the growth you’ve experienced since you began your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. You’re an incredible talent, and I hope you’ll put your skills to use.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_2
TEXT: You see, I want you to help other Trainers become the best they can be. Your experience comes with a lot of responsibility, and I hope you’ll continue to show kindness, patience, and friendship to those who could benefit from your guidance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_3
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is a beautiful place, and I want you to lead by example and show everyone how amazing our community can be while protecting it from the likes of Team GO Rocket and anyone else who would threaten it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_4
TEXT: Remember how it felt the first time you caught a Pokémon, the first time you took a walk with your buddy, the first time you challenged a raid—and channel that energy into everything you do. With your strong heart and peerless determination, there’s nothing you can’t do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_5
TEXT: I can only hope you’re as proud of yourself as the team leaders and I are of you. Don’t worry—I’ll always be here when you need me, and you can be sure I’ll be calling on you from time to time to help me with research. There’s always something more to discover, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_6
TEXT: Thanks for everything, %PLAYERNAME%. I know I can always count on you! And I’m sure you know what I’m about to say, so before I get too choked up—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2
TEXT: Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3
TEXT: There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4
TEXT: I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5
TEXT: Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6
TEXT: Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1
TEXT: As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2
TEXT: My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4
TEXT: When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5
TEXT: And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6
TEXT: As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0
TEXT: You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1
TEXT: Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2
TEXT: Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3
TEXT: Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4
TEXT: There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got your very own Magmortar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_1
TEXT: Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_2
TEXT: Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_3
TEXT: Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_4
TEXT: See you around, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1
