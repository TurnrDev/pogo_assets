TEXT: The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn't dry out.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0705

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_2
TEXT: It didn’t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab’s electricity would make an excellent snack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_3
TEXT: Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4
TEXT: Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_5
TEXT: The research would be valuable, and I’d be grateful to have my power restored!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_2
TEXT: Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_3
TEXT: A weak electric current flows between Elekid’s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_4
TEXT: Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5
TEXT: Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2
TEXT: Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3
TEXT: Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_4
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what electrifying facts we’ll learn about that Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_0
TEXT: I just don’t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_1
TEXT: OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2
TEXT: According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3
TEXT: When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_4
TEXT: Be careful with this Pokémon when battling with it—that’s a lot of power you’re dealing with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5
TEXT: With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6
TEXT: Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0
TEXT: BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1
TEXT: Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2
TEXT: Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3
TEXT: Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4
TEXT: Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5
TEXT: Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6
TEXT: Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0
TEXT: Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1
TEXT: What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2
TEXT: Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3
TEXT: After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4
TEXT: The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5
TEXT: Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0
TEXT: Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2
TEXT: I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3
TEXT: There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4
TEXT: One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6
TEXT: I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0
TEXT: Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!

TEXT: Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2
TEXT: Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3
TEXT: All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4
TEXT: Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5
TEXT: I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2
TEXT: Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3
TEXT: There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4
TEXT: I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5
TEXT: Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6
TEXT: Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1
TEXT: As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2
TEXT: My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4
TEXT: When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5
TEXT: And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6
TEXT: As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0
TEXT: You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1
TEXT: Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2
TEXT: Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3
TEXT: Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4
TEXT: There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got your very own Magmortar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_1
TEXT: Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_2
TEXT: Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_3
TEXT: Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_4
