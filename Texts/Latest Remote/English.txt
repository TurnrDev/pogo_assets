RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_1
TEXT: It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2
TEXT: It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3
TEXT: Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1
TEXT: Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2
TEXT: Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0
TEXT: On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1
TEXT: Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2
TEXT: I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3
TEXT: Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0
TEXT: So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1
TEXT: Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2
TEXT: I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3
TEXT: Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0
TEXT: I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2
TEXT: I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1
TEXT: That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1
TEXT: Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2
TEXT: ...Uh, moving along...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3
TEXT: Weedle’s horn measures about two inches. It’s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate Weedle further—but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to get poked by one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0
TEXT: Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research—Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1
TEXT: It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and—in my opinion—honkable nose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2
TEXT: I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don’t think to offer me any.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s Evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0
TEXT: Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1
TEXT: Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2
TEXT: And that’s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn’t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we’ve learned so much about what’s happening to Kakuna!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it’s been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0
TEXT: Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1
TEXT: Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2
TEXT: This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pokémon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn’t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab’s tires!
