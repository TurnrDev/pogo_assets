RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. As you know, I do a lot of research. There are just so many Pokémon to learn about and document!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Recently, I’ve been investigating Ralts, the Feeling Pokémon, to learn more about how this Pokémon senses people’s emotions by using the horns on its head.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: It’s an amazing ability, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I thought studying this Pokémon’s unique sensing powers could help me identify the strange feeling that’s been stirring inside me these past few weeks.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I’ve realized, though, that this isn’t any ordinary emotion—it’s a type of energy!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: This mysterious energy is filling me with hope and determination. I feel like I could take on any challenge and be victorious!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_6
TEXT: I would appreciate your assistance in collecting more information on this strange and fascinating phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing the research we needed to get started, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: While you were catching Pokémon and visiting PokéStops, I started digging through my research and found references to a phenomenon that seems to have a lot in common with what I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: The reports refer to a Mythical Pokémon that shares the infinite energy it creates with others to guarantee victory.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: The reports also state that this Pokémon is Psychic- and Fire-type. What an amazing combination!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: To get closer to confirming the source of the energy, let’s focus our efforts on catching Pokémon that share those same types.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts researching Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, we’re well on our way to confirming the source of this mysterious energy.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: There’s many a mystery surrounding our path forward, so I’ll keep poring over our research notes. In the meantime, I’d like you to work on becoming better friends with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: As a Trainer, strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon is an important task that requires a specific set of skills.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: To further develop those skills, why don’t you try spending time with your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Successful partnerships take work and dedication, and talented Trainers build lifelong friendships with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: That being said, be sure to spend time with your buddy every day!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: You have a wonderful bond with your buddy, Trainer! It’s been a treat watching that friendship bloom. Now, though, it’s time to focus our efforts on the matter at hand!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: After further examination of the research you completed, I’m convinced that the Pokémon we’re looking for is Victini, the Victory Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only would this be consistent with the references to a Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, but it would also explain the mysterious surge of energy I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: It’s time for you to befriend Victini. Since this Pokémon represents victory, I think winning a few battles might inspire it to come forward!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: I’ve been hearing reports that Team GO Rocket is causing trouble. Battling these troublemakers just might show this Pokémon you’re worthy of attention!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Let’s see whether some victory will attract the Victory Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Absolutely astounding, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d be able to display your powerful bonds and battle prowess to impress the Mythical Pokémon Victini.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: It shares the infinite energy it creates when its body overflows with power, so I’m absolutely certain now that the energy I was feeling was coming directly from Victini!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: Be sure to use this power wisely, %PLAYERNAME%, as you and Victini take on new challenges. But for now, your hard work calls for a celebration!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: Why don’t you take a few snapshots with Victini and share your success with fellow Trainers by sending them some Gifts?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_0
TEXT: Once again, you have helped me uncover a huge discovery. I cannot thank you enough for your time and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is filled with endless discoveries and it isn’t everyday we come across a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: I hope that you will take the lessons we learned together through this investigation and apply them to your training.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: I’m proud of you, %PLAYERNAME%, and hope you continue to strive to be your very best. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1
TEXT: Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2
TEXT: After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_3
TEXT: It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4
TEXT: I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5
TEXT: After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6
TEXT: It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7
TEXT: Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1
TEXT: Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2
TEXT: My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3
TEXT: It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4
TEXT: It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5
TEXT: Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6
TEXT: Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0
TEXT: Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1
TEXT: I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2
TEXT: While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3
TEXT: Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4
TEXT: Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6
TEXT: I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0
TEXT: I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1
TEXT: I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2
TEXT: I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4
TEXT: I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5
TEXT: In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_6
TEXT: However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_7
TEXT: You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.
