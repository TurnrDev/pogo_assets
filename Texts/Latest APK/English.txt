RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. As you know, I do a lot of research. There are just so many Pokémon to learn about and document!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Recently, I’ve been investigating Ralts, the Feeling Pokémon, to learn more about how this Pokémon senses people’s emotions by using the horns on its head.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: It’s an amazing ability, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I thought studying this Pokémon’s unique sensing powers could help me identify the strange feeling that’s been stirring inside me these past few weeks.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I’ve realized, though, that this isn’t any ordinary emotion—it’s a type of energy!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: This mysterious energy is filling me with hope and determination. I feel like I could take on any challenge and be victorious!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_6
TEXT: I would appreciate your assistance in collecting more information on this strange and fascinating phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing the research we needed to get started, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: While you were catching Pokémon and visiting PokéStops, I started digging through my research and found references to a phenomenon that seems to have a lot in common with what I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: The reports refer to a Mythical Pokémon that shares the infinite energy it creates with others to guarantee victory.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: The reports also state that this Pokémon is Psychic- and Fire-type. What an amazing combination!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: To get closer to confirming the source of the energy, let’s focus our efforts on catching Pokémon that share those same types.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts researching Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, we’re well on our way to confirming the source of this mysterious energy.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: There’s many a mystery surrounding our path forward, so I’ll keep poring over our research notes. In the meantime, I’d like you to work on becoming better friends with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: As a Trainer, strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon is an important task that requires a specific set of skills.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: To further develop those skills, why don’t you try spending time with your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Successful partnerships take work and dedication, and talented Trainers build lifelong friendships with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: That being said, be sure to spend time with your buddy every day!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: You have a wonderful bond with your buddy, Trainer! It’s been a treat watching that friendship bloom. Now, though, it’s time to focus our efforts on the matter at hand!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: After further examination of the research you completed, I’m convinced that the Pokémon we’re looking for is Victini, the Victory Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only would this be consistent with the references to a Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, but it would also explain the mysterious surge of energy I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: It’s time for you to befriend Victini. Since this Pokémon represents victory, I think winning a few battles might inspire it to come forward!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: I’ve been hearing reports that Team GO Rocket is causing trouble. Battling these troublemakers just might show this Pokémon you’re worthy of attention!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Let’s see whether some victory will attract the Victory Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Absolutely astounding, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d be able to display your powerful bonds and battle prowess to impress the Mythical Pokémon Victini.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: It shares the infinite energy it creates when its body overflows with power, so I’m absolutely certain now that the energy I was feeling was coming directly from Victini!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: Be sure to use this power wisely, %PLAYERNAME%, as you and Victini take on new challenges. But for now, your hard work calls for a celebration!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: Why don’t you take a few snapshots with Victini and share your success with fellow Trainers by sending them some Gifts?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_0
TEXT: Once again, you have helped me uncover a huge discovery. I cannot thank you enough for your time and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is filled with endless discoveries, and it isn’t every day we come across a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: I hope that you will take the lessons we learned together through this investigation and apply them to your training.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: I’m proud of you, %PLAYERNAME%, and hope you continue to strive to be your very best. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_6
TEXT: It brings a smile to my face knowing that millions of Trainers around the world are working together right now because of their shared love of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_7

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, by the look on your face, I’m sure you’ve grasped the situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket confetti is raining down from the sky. Grunts are invading PokéStops all around the world. And...Team GO Rocket has taken over Pokémon GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: We thought we put a stop to them when we ended their take-over during our research leading up to GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: But that take-over appears to have been only part of a larger plan. We have yet to determine Team GO Rocket’s ultimate goal, though. Regardless of what it is, %PLAYERNAME%...you must prepare yourself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: I’m impressed by your energy and that of your fellow Trainers around the world! If we work together, I know victory is within our reach!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Pokémon are ready for battle, and I bet your fellow Trainers are thankful for the supplies you’ve sent their way. We’ll need to work together to keep Team GO Rocket at bay and save Pokémon GO Fest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Oh, what’s this? Looks like the snapshots you took feature some unwelcome guests! It’s amazing that Team GO Rocket can organize these massive take-overs, but its members do seem a little silly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe these photobombs are actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don’t you put all your training to use? In the meantime, I’ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, you’ve caught a Golem!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been scoping out the Team GO Rocket balloons and have discovered that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are using Flying-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Sources told me that Team GO Rocket might’ve captured some Legendary Pokémon and turned them into Shadow Pokémon, too!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: If I recall correctly, the team leaders saw one of these balloons at GO Fest last year—and another during the Team GO Rocket take-over a few weeks ago.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t have imagined that Team GO Rocket would spend resources on such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it’s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into providing his Grunts with balloons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to rock Team GO Rocket’s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo. Now all that’s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela can handle the Team GO Rocket Leaders while you prepare to face the boss. It’s interesting that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are commanding these Legendary Shadow Pokémon, which are usually reserved for the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll learn what this means as we uncover Team GO Rocket’s devious plans and discover what Pokémon Giovanni now has under his control.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: On the bright side, I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that powerful energy I detected yesterday?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: The team leaders reported that Trainers worldwide suddenly felt a similar energy that filled them with hope and determination. Through my research, I found references to that very same energy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: They document a Mythical Pokémon that shares its infinite energy with others and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling that’s why Team GO Rocket is here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: Perhaps Team GO Rocket hopes to further its dastardly plans by using this powerful Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pokémon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type attacks. The Machamp you caught earlier might help you here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_8
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. The fate of Pokémon GO Fest is in your hands.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and sent him packing! Who would’ve thought that he could turn even Mewtwo into a Shadow Pokémon? That alone is a mystery we need to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: It was a tough battle, and the fact that you defeated Mewtwo proves what an amazing Trainer you are.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela were victorious against the Team GO Rocket Leaders and drove them away, too.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: Thanks to everyone’s efforts, we’ve saved Pokémon GO Fest! It’s time to celebrate!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Turns out, Team GO Rocket was after Victini, the Victory Pokémon! Some say this Pokémon brings victory to its Trainer, regardless of the contest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: I’m now sure that the energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I’m in utter awe of your tenacity and determination. Pokémon GO Fest was saved because of your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Phew! Now, I think we should get back to having fun. There’s still time to enjoy the festivities!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: While this year’s GO Fest was quite a bit different from previous ones, I’m overjoyed that Trainers all over the world could still come together to celebrate—and protect—our beloved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I have the honor of making them today because you’re about to head out on your own Kanto-inspired journey.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: But we can’t have you leaving unprepared! I’ve put together some supplies I think you’ll find useful.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Berries, Potions, and Poké Balls. Looks like you’re all set!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: As you begin today’s adventure, try to imagine you’re stepping straight into the tall grass of Kanto.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I have a feeling you’ll meet a Pokémon that will make a wonderful partner on your journey. Be sure to take some snapshots of the Pokémon you encounter along the way!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: On adventures, I find it’s helpful to document not only your findings but also your memories. And I’m sure you’ll make plenty of both!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Now, in the words of a wise professor: Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits! Let's GO!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: How’s your journey going, %PLAYERNAME%? Oh! Found a partner Pokémon to join you, eh? Wonderful work.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: In the Kanto region, Trainers are often presented with three options when it comes to their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: The first is Bulbasaur, the Seed Pokémon, #001 in the Pokédex. This Grass-type Pokémon has a plant seed on its back right from the day it’s born.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Another option is Charmander, the Lizard Pokémon. It’s a Fire-type Pokémon, and it has a flame on its tail that shows the strength of its life force.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: Last—but certainly not least—is Squirtle, the Tiny Turtle Pokémon. After birth, this Water-type Pokémon's back swells and hardens into a shell.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Each of these Pokémon have their strengths and weaknesses, so be sure to study up! For now, though, it’s time to get back to your adventure.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: I’d like you to spend some time with your buddy. The relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon is of utmost importance!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: How about going on a walk together? I always enjoy exploring with my buddy!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer! Glad to see you’re growing closer to your buddy. Keep it up, and you’ll become even closer in no time.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: When it comes to being a Trainer, people often talk about catching techniques or battle strategies, but I find that friendship is just as essential.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only are the relationships you build with your Pokémon incredibly important, but so are the friendships you build with other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: Your personal journeys and goals may vary, but at the end of the day, you’re all Trainers! You should do your best to connect with the other Trainers you meet on your travels.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: In that spirit, how about sending your friends some Gifts to brighten their day? I’m sure they’d love to hear from you!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Hope you enjoyed connecting with other Trainers. I see you were even able to trade a few Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: Trading is a fabulous way to acquire Pokémon you might not have otherwise encountered.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: And not only do you get a new entry in your Pokédex, but you also get a new friend!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: You’ve already made great progress on your journey. I think it’s time to show off the skills you’ve learned along the way!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_4
TEXT: How about showcasing your throwing expertise by catching some Pokémon? Don’t forget to make use of your Berries, too.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_5
TEXT: I’m especially fond of Pinap Berries. They help you earn extra Candy for the Pokémon you’re catching—and they’re tasty to boot!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_0
TEXT: I’m sure I had a stash of Pinap Berries here somewhere... Oh! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess my snack will have to wait.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: I’ve been checking up on your progress, and I have to say, I’m very impressed! It seems there’s no challenge you can’t overcome.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: As I’m sure you know, a well-rounded Trainer needs to have a great team of Pokémon to battle against other Trainers or even challenge Pokémon in raids.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: I think this is a great time to power up some of your Pokémon and bolster your team.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_4
TEXT: While you focus on that, I’ll be looking into an interesting rumor I caught wind of.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_5
TEXT: There have been reports of encounters with a Pokémon that’s able to transform into another Pokémon entirely. Fascinating stuff!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_6
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share whatever I find when you return.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_0
TEXT: Glad you’re back, Trainer. After looking into those reports, it certainly sounds like the work of Ditto, the Transform Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_1
TEXT: Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other shapes. What an incredible Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_2
TEXT: However, there seems to be something more to this situation.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_3
TEXT: Could you help me with some research so we can find out what exactly is going on?

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_4
TEXT: I’ll continue my work here to see if I can uncover some more information that might help us.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Is it true?! You encountered a Shiny Ditto?! I’m stunned!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_1
TEXT: You’ve had quite the journey, haven’t you? It’s been a joy to follow your progress, as always.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, though, there’s still another mystery that needs solving.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_3
TEXT: You see, after looking over the research you’ve conducted, I think we might be on the trail of the New Species Pokémon, Mew.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_4
TEXT: We've documented Mew in the past, but something’s different this time—though I can’t yet say what that is.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_5
TEXT: Whatever the case, I think it’s safe to say this is going to be a memorable adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_6
TEXT: In the meantime, keep an eye out for another research assignment. I have a feeling this is going to be an especially challenging endeavor, but I’m sure you’re up to it!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_7
TEXT: For now, though, I think congratulations are in order. You did a tremendous job on today’s Kanto-themed journey!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_8

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to have you aboard this expedition. Say, have you ever heard this particular tune?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Da da da doo, da dee da dum... That’s what I hear in my head when I think of a certain sailor and his Wingull that I met while traveling through the Hoenn region in my younger years.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: I believe the tune was originally a sea shanty. Sailors would sing songs like this together on their seafaring adventures to keep morale high and help find a rhythm during certain tasks.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I’m no sailor, but I do find myself feeling luckier after humming it! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: Anyway, we’re here to look into the strange situation we uncovered during your Kanto-themed journey.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: I’m talking, of course, about reports of encounters with Mew, the New Species Pokémon. There have been several sightings of a Shiny one recently, which is tremendously exciting!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_6
TEXT: That means our goal on this expedition is to find not only one of the most elusive Pokémon to ever exist, but a Shiny one at that!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_7
TEXT: You’ve experienced a lot on your journeys thus far, %PLAYERNAME%. But perhaps the most wonderful thing about Pokémon is that there’s always something new to discover.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_8
TEXT: I hope you’re excited for what’s to come, because I have a feeling it’s going to be a real test of your skills as a Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_9
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%—great work! Your knowledge of the Kanto region is beginning to rival even my own!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: Our next task is to learn more about Pokémon DNA.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I know that sounds pretty heavy on the science, but don’t worry—I’ll take care of that part. All I need you to do is get out there and catch lots of different types of Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: Mew’s DNA is said to contain the genetic codes of all Pokémon, so to better understand Mew, we should try to understand as much as we can about the genetics of other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing you learn so much about different Pokémon reminded me of how vast the world of Pokémon truly is.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Knowledge is funny in that the more we gain, the more realize how much we still lack. Some might find that frustrating, but for me it’s inspiring!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: You know, there’s a part in that sea shanty I mentioned before that seems applicable here.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: I don’t remember the exact words, but the gist is that we should travel across the land, searching far and wide to learn about all the amazing Pokémon there are in the world.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: Words to live by, I say! Let’s get out there and track down that Shiny Mew, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you... You did it! You actually found and caught a Shiny Mew!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: Has it even sunk in yet? This is a monumental achievement, Trainer. Take a moment to congratulate yourself!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Hm? It’s my achievement as well? Haha! No, no, I just hummed you a shanty and guided you like any Pokémon Professor worth their sea salt would.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: But thanks are certainly in order for the Pokémon you’ve befriended on your journey. They played a big part in your research, after all!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: The ones you’ve caught, the ones you’ve battled with, and the ones that traveled with you as your buddy—each Pokémon played a critical part in helping you achieve this goal.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: As Trainers, we owe an eternal debt to our Pokémon. After all, we can’t very well be Trainers without them!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_6
TEXT: A Trainer’s journey is meant to be filled with amazing memories, ambitious dreams, and unexpected adventures. I think this particular journey checked all those boxes pretty handily!

To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Service that you access.<br><br>11. Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pokémon GO<br><br>Pokémon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pokémon GO using your third-party Pokémon Trainer Club (“PTC”) account administered by The Pokémon Company International (“TPCI”). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the “Accounts with Children” paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pokémon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (“Parent”) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (“Child”), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child’s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent’s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent’s social security number and the Parent’s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent’s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pokémon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child’s access to and use of Pokémon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child’s registration on Pokémon GO and prevent the Child’s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child’s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child’s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pokémon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child’s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data. If you use Pokémon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data about your fitness activity (Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the “Health App Data”).   We may store Health App Data on our servers in connection with your Pokémon GO user account.   We use Health App Data to provide you certain functionality in the game (such as distances walked to hatch Eggs), and to ensure you get “credit” in your Apple Health App for all of the walking you do while playing Pokémon GO.  We will not use Health App Data for marketing or advertising purposes.  We do not store Health App Data in iCloud.  Pokémon GO cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.<br>Additional Privacy Information for Ingress<br><br>Information shared publicly. When you play Ingress, as part of the gameplay the following information about you will be shared through the game (including with other players directly within the app, in game notifications emailed to other players as part of the gameplay, and online on the Ingress Intel Map website), and will therefore become publicly available: your in-game username, messages sent to other users in COMMS, and in-game portals that you interact with, as well as your device location whenever you take an in-game action.<br>

TEXT: Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. I always run into you when I find something exciting. Maybe you’re my Special Research good-luck charm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_1
TEXT: Last night, I was studying the chemical reaction that causes Trubbish to appear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_2
TEXT: Suddenly I saw bright flashing lights in the near distance and went to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_3
TEXT: When I arrived at the site, I noticed a lot of damage to the ground and the surrounding area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_4
TEXT: At first, the damage looked to be caused by Trainers practicing for the GO Battle League, but my gut told me to investigate further in the morning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_5
TEXT: While I look into this, can you help me research Normal-type Pokémon? Some of the damage looks like it was caused by a Normal-type attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_0
TEXT: Thanks for getting that baseline research taken care of for me, %PLAYERNAME%. I have some updates to share with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_1
TEXT: After I returned to the site we’re studying, I realized there was actually a trail of damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_2
TEXT: When I followed that trail, I started finding areas that were clearly burned.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_3
TEXT: That damage must have been done by a Fire-type Pokémon—or at least a Pokémon that knows Fire-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_4
TEXT: You know what this means, Trainer! Time to research Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_5
TEXT: The more information we have about this type of Pokémon, the more clues we’ll have to determine whatever did all this damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_6
TEXT: Meanwhile, I’ll continue following the trail of damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You’re on fire?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_1
TEXT: Anyway...the damage can’t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_2
TEXT: Could it really have been caused by Pokémon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pokémon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_3
TEXT: As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn’t seem to line up with any Pokémon I’ve encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’m so glad you’re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_1
TEXT: I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_2
TEXT: She shared some notes about a Mythical Pokémon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_3
TEXT: Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pokémon is Bug and Steel type, it’s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_4
TEXT: This lines up with the damage at the site we’ve been researching!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5
TEXT: One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_6
TEXT: I’ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pokémon to help us get to the bottom of this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_0
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_1
TEXT: With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we’ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon Genesect!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_2
TEXT: I know what you’re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3
TEXT: Apparently, when this Pokémon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pokémon’s holding.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_4
TEXT: I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_5
TEXT: I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pokémon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_6
TEXT: You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I’ve come across something...groundbreaking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_1
TEXT: I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_2
TEXT: At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_3
TEXT: These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pokémon in particular.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_4
TEXT: Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pokémon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_0
TEXT: Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_1
TEXT: This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pokémon. I wonder if we’ll find another Pokémon that will help us solve this puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_2
TEXT: I have one in mind, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_3
TEXT: I’m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we’ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_0
TEXT: As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_1
TEXT: I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pokémon. It’s said that it made Pokémon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_2
TEXT: Could it be these Pokémon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_3
TEXT: If the first two Pokémon were Regirock and Regice...then there’s only one left that we must research further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work. I believe we’re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_1
TEXT: We’re close to coming across the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pokémon towed continents with rope.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_2
TEXT: Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_3
TEXT: Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you’ll make a colossal discovery of your own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_0
TEXT: Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_1
TEXT: I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I’ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pokémon deep in slumber.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_2
TEXT: We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_3
TEXT: Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I’ll see if I can find anything about this Pokémon in any of my texts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure the resources you’ve earned will be crucial.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_1
TEXT: I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pokémon that grants wishes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_2
TEXT: I’m still researching the best way to awaken this Pokémon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pokémon in the area showing signs of distress.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_3
TEXT: Could I ask you to investigate these reports?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_1
TEXT: Many of the Pokémon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_2
TEXT: I’d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I’m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_3
TEXT: As you return the Pokémon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pokémon in their habitats?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_1
TEXT: Apparently there’s an unusual phenomenon where Pokémon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I’ve heard Spark refer to it as a “photobomb.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_2
TEXT: I’m eternally amused—and amazed—by the things we learn about Pokémon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_3
TEXT: These Pokémon all seem to have something in common—music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_4
TEXT: What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_0
TEXT: That’s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pokémon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_1
TEXT: The ancient text was right—this Mythical Pokémon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be—I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_3
TEXT: It isn’t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pokémon in such diverse habitats—not to mention meeting a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_4
TEXT: I’m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I’ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_0
TEXT: Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m excited to get started on our next big adventure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_1
TEXT: What do we need to do? Well, I’ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_2
TEXT: We’re going to focus our efforts on Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pokémon I’ve never seen before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_3
TEXT: First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_4
TEXT: Can you explore the area? Who knows—you might make some friends along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_0
TEXT: Great job, Trainer. Your work helped me get a better understanding of the search area for this mysterious Pokémon. I can’t wait to show you what I’ve been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_1
TEXT: A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_2
TEXT: It mentions a Mythical Pokémon that awakens once every thousand years and has the ability to grant wishes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_3
TEXT: I really want to get a deeper understanding of this text, and how better to do that than with some research? Can you help me collect some information on Pokémon from the Hoenn region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Hoenn Pokédex is really looking great!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_1
TEXT: The Whismur you caught reminded me of a line from the text I told you about. It mentioned that a melody or a sound can awaken a sleeping Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_2
TEXT: That gives me an idea... Let’s do a little experiment. There’s a sleeping Snorlax that hasn’t left my lab in months. And it’s right in front of my Berry stash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_3
TEXT: Think we could wake it up with a loud noise? Let’s document the Whismur Evolution line, too—some photos will do.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_0
TEXT: Wow! That sure was loud, but it did the trick! Loudred worked just like an alarm clock for poor Snorlax.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_1
TEXT: I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we’ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_2
TEXT: If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pokémon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_3
TEXT: The text says that the Pokémon is a Steel and Psychic type, so I think a good next step is to catch a few Pokémon with similar characteristics.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_4
TEXT: We’ll need a few extra hands to get this done, too. Could you get some fellow Trainers to help out?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I’ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_1
TEXT: It says that when the Mythical Pokémon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_2
TEXT: Another interesting tidbit: If this Pokémon senses danger, it will fight without awakening. Up for a Trainer Battle, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_3
TEXT: If the battle causes any reactions nearby, I have sensors set up to detect them. It might seem like a long shot, but I have a good feeling about this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_0
TEXT: It worked! I’m picking up some vibrations nearby. I think we’re on the right track.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_1
TEXT: Maybe the Mythical Pokémon is close to awakening. Since what we’re doing is working, let’s keep it up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_2
TEXT: We need to pull out all the stops, though, and the timing has to be just right.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_3
TEXT: I’ll hold things down here with Loudred while you keep focusing on encountering Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_4
TEXT: If you can do that, I think it’ll help the Mythical Pokémon see that you’re a worthy Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_0
TEXT: Simply astonishing! We encountered the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_1
TEXT: That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Well, once in several lifetimes, if Jirachi truly only wakes once every thousand years.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_2
TEXT: You’ve become such an accomplished Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%. Thank you for going on this amazing adventure with me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_3
TEXT: You can bet I’ll be in touch whenever another exciting research project comes up. Until then, let’s get out there and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_0
TEXT: How was 2019 for you, %PLAYERNAME%? For me, it was a fantastic year, and I want to thank you and all our Trainers around the world for your hard work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_1
TEXT: Together, we took on Team GO Rocket, uncovered the Wish Pokémon, Jirachi, and began encountering Pokémon originally discovered in Unova.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_2
TEXT: I want to make sure you know how proud I am of how much you and all the other Trainers have grown this last year!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_3
TEXT: And now with 2020 on the horizon, there are sure to be many more adventures awaiting! Until then, let’s get up and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: I was just out on a stroll and witnessed the most incredible sight. Several rings had appeared in the sky, and as I stared up at them, something truly remarkable occurred.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Legendary Pokémon began emerging from the rings as if by magic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: I did have some luck in my search for an explanation, however. Look here—it’s the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa enjoys sending things to faraway places using its rings, which can warp space.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: That explains why those Legendary Pokémon appeared the way they did. Hoopa uses those rings to move things from place to place—including itself. It won’t be easy to catch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Based on reports from the team leaders, it doesn’t seem like Hoopa is in the area at the moment. Let’s use this time to prepare to catch it, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_7

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_1
TEXT: Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra’s ability to teleport.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_2
TEXT: When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it’s made copies of itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_3
TEXT: However, what’s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let’s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_1
TEXT: It’s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_3
TEXT: I’ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I’ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_0
TEXT: I’m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I’m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_1
TEXT: While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it’s sleeping! What amazing abilities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_2
TEXT: Why don’t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I’ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I’ve developed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_3
TEXT: While it won’t give you Abra’s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_0
TEXT: Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_1
TEXT: We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pokémon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_2
TEXT: Pokémon are truly amazing creatures. There’s always something to discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_3
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Just who I wanted to see. I just received a unique research request regarding a particular Pokémon, and I think you’re the perfect Trainer to help me with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: Let’s warm up with a few tasks first, and then we can dive into the meat of it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. I have a few more details to share about the research request I received.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: A favorite of new and experienced Trainers alike, Bidoof, the Plump Mouse Pokémon, has been appearing more often of late. Intriguing, no?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Now, before we continue, I have a very important choice for you to make. Will you focus your research on Bidoof or the Plump Mouse Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Is this a trick question? Who could say! My only advice is to follow your heart. Besides, it’s hard to go wrong when Bidoof is your only option!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: Great choice, Trainer! For some reason, I just knew you’d pick Bidoof. Don’t ask me how!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Bidoof is known for its two large front teeth. Much like Rattata’s teeth, Bidoof’s teeth are continually growing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: Speaking of teeth, I have a few tasks that you can sink yours into now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: Wonderful choice, Trainer! I had a feeling you’d pick the Plump Mouse Pokémon. Don’t ask me why!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Otherwise known as Bidoof, this Normal-type Pokémon is far from ordinary! While only about a foot tall, Bidoof is powerful. It can chew through boulders with its incisors—a feat that makes my jaw hurt to even think about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Hopefully you got a few good snapshots of Bidoof while conducting your research! I always enjoy seeing the snapshots Trainers take of Pokémon, and I can never get enough of Bidoof!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_1
TEXT: Now—according to the research request we received, we must choose to focus our efforts on a Pokémon that has nerves of steel or a Pokémon that nests alongside water.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_2
TEXT: I know what you’re thinking: choosing between Bidoof and Bidoof isn’t easy. But, then again, the most important research rarely is!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: You’re going with Bidoof, huh? I like your style, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Bidoof isn’t just cute to look at—it’s more agile and active than it appears! Nothing can perturb it, making it an excellent member of your team. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: I think we could all learn from that steadiness. Channel your inner Bidoof so you can steel your nerves, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: You choose Bidoof, eh? I never doubted it for a second.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Bidoof often live in groups by the water where they make their nests. I recall that Bibarel, Bidoof’s Evolution, makes its nest by damming streams with bark and mud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: A river dammed by Bibarel will never overflow its banks, which is appreciated by people nearby. Fascinating, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%, for assisting me with this special assignment. I think we all learned that there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to Pokémon—especially Bidoof!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_1
TEXT: As a thank-you for your hard work, the team leaders and I prepared a gift for you to help show the world your love and knowledge of the indelible Bidoof. I hope you wear it with the pride it deserves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: Why don’t you put it on and enjoy a nice walk with your Bidoof? You never know what you might discover! Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’ve been such a help in conducting Field Research and Special Research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_1
TEXT: I have a feeling that there’s so much more about this world that we’ve yet to discover, and I’m glad I can count on you to see it through.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_2
TEXT: I’ve been doing some experiments of my own, and I suspect that I’m onto a further exciting discovery about another Mythical Pokémon that’s rarely seen.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_3
TEXT: Would you mind completing these tasks while I conclude my studies?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_0
TEXT: Wow, you and your Pokémon have some amazing power! But according to my most recent data, it seems that the Mythical Pokémon I’m tracking only appears in times of peace.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_1
TEXT: Also, from what I’ve gathered, it seems fond of forests and lush greens. Would you mind exploring this further, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_2
TEXT: Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I feel we’re getting closer to this Mythical Pokémon. I wonder if we can find some more friends for it by hatching some Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_1
TEXT: Ah, and maybe you could put that Sun Stone you’ve earned to good use as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_2
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_0
TEXT: Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that this Pokémon’s unstable genetic makeup enables it to take on one of several different Evolutions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_2
TEXT: I’ll bet if you spend some time with it during the day, you’ll be able to evolve your Eevee into an Espeon—a Psychic-type Pokémon just like the Mythical Pokémon I’m researching!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_3
TEXT: Can you {0}, {1}, and {2}?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_0
TEXT: Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_1
TEXT: Wait... Have we...had this conversation already? I’m getting a funny feeling in the back of my mind—like we’ve been here before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_2
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, would you spend some time with this Eevee during the night? I think you’ll be able to see an intriguing evolved form as a result.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_3
TEXT: I wonder if this funny feeling will recur...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I have some exciting news! That funny feeling hasn’t returned, but I did some important reading and learned that the Mythical Pokémon we’re researching has the ability to travel across time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_1
TEXT: Maybe that’s why all of this is occurring...or recurring... Maybe this Pokémon is nearby?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_2
TEXT: I suggest that you collect samples over the course of the next week and experiment with some Evolution items to see whether that feeling occurs again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_3
TEXT: While you’re at it, do you have any Pinap Berries? My research could benefit from more data on their use. Return with that, and you can have these exotic Silver Pinap Berries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_0
TEXT: This data is so helpful. Thank you! I’ll use it to explore my theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_1
TEXT: While you were in the field, I made more headway in learning about this Mythical Pokémon, and it seems that its mere presence causes grass and trees to flourish.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_2
TEXT: I think if you catch more Grass-type Pokémon, this elusive time-traveling Pokémon will reveal itself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_3
TEXT: Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, what an amazing experience! The appearance of the Mythical Pokémon Celebi is thought to be a sign that a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_1
TEXT: You’ve come a long way in your research, and I must say you’re inspiring me to discover even more Pokémon. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you and your fellow Trainers have been taking care of yourselves. Remember to take a break every now and then to do something you really enjoy! I like to go on short walks, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_1
TEXT: In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pokémon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_2
TEXT: Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_3
TEXT: Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn’t the first time I’ve witnessed such a gathering...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_4
TEXT: Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_2
TEXT: For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pokémon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_3
TEXT: Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_4
TEXT: Charmander’s evolved form is Charmeleon—but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_0
TEXT: That’s a fine Charmeleon you’ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_1
TEXT: Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_2
TEXT: When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_3
TEXT: The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_4
TEXT: Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pokémon! Come back and see me once you’ve evolved your Charmeleon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pokémon Charizard!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_1
TEXT: Charizard is a truly amazing Pokémon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_2
TEXT: While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_3
TEXT: What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_4
TEXT: They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_0
TEXT: I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_1
TEXT: Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_2
TEXT: Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_3
TEXT: It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_4
TEXT: Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_5
TEXT: Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_6
TEXT: Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you. Can you believe this year is already coming to a close?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_1
TEXT: It’s almost as if Pokémon in the wild can feel it, too. A few seem to be appearing in greater numbers than usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_2
TEXT: Strangely enough, the Pokémon appearing more frequently at the moment seem to be the same as those that did so previously throughout this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_3
TEXT: Seeing all these Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup in the wild is making me a bit nostalgic. We’ve had quite a year, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_4
TEXT: As you venture out to catch these Pokémon, I think it might be nice to reminisce on some of the highlights from this year and how much you’ve grown as a Pokémon Trainer along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_5
TEXT: Who knows—you might even surprise yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_0
TEXT: Great job catching all those Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_1
TEXT: As you were doing that, I was busy thinking about all we’ve accomplished together this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_2
TEXT: We discovered the secrets of trade Evolution and met a vast variety of Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_3
TEXT: We even encountered Legendary Pokémon like Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, and Kyurem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_4
TEXT: Then there were the Pokémon originally discovered in the Galar region. I was particularly excited to see Galarian Ponyta, Galarian Rapidash, and Sirfetch’d!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_5
TEXT: Oh! And who could forget the mysterious appearance of Mega-Evolved Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_6
TEXT: Hard to believe we fit all that into one year, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, I’ve rambled on long enough. It’s time for you to get back out there and catch some more Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_0
TEXT: Ah—Weedle, Gastly, and Seedot. The stars of some memorable days this past year! I still get a bit jumpy at the sight of acorns. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_1
TEXT: Gastly gave us a bit of a fright as well. Remember?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_2
TEXT: OOOooooOOOoooo... BOO! Haha, sorry—I couldn’t help it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_3
TEXT: You know, Gastly isn’t the only gaseous thing we saw in abundance this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_4
TEXT: That’s right—I’m talking about Team GO Rocket taking to the sky in balloons! An almost cartoonish mode of transportation, and yet surprisingly effective.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_5
TEXT: You know, if the members of Team GO Rocket weren’t so devoted to villainy, their assets and energy would likely make them great allies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_6
TEXT: I hope that world comes to be someday.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_7
TEXT: Ah, pardon my wistfulness. I tend to get more and more pensive as the day wears on. Does that happen to you as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_8
TEXT: Perhaps you can ponder that while you go out and catch more Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_0
TEXT: It’s certainly been an interesting year, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%? I can’t remember another one like it, and I’ve seen a few!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_1
TEXT: But despite all the ways it’s challenged us, I can’t help but think that it’ll make future experiences feel even more precious and special.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_2
TEXT: After all, no matter what happens, we’re all on this Pokémon journey together—every Trainer, regardless of where they are in the world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_3
TEXT: That’s truly something special.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_4
TEXT: So when the going gets tough, remember that you’re not in this alone. And while bad days are inevitable, I like to think they make the good ones that much sweeter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_5
TEXT: I hope today has been one of the good ones for you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_6
TEXT: The world is ever changing, %PLAYERNAME%. What doesn’t change, however, is the fact that we have each other and our Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_7
TEXT: And as the mysterious world of Pokémon continues to grow, so do we—as Trainers, as a community, and as people.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_8
TEXT: So here’s to a year for the books—and many more exciting ones to come!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_2
TEXT: It didn’t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab’s electricity would make an excellent snack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_3
TEXT: Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4
TEXT: Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_5
TEXT: The research would be valuable, and I’d be grateful to have my power restored!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_2
TEXT: Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_3
TEXT: A weak electric current flows between Elekid’s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_4
TEXT: Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5
TEXT: Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2
TEXT: Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3
TEXT: Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_4
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what electrifying facts we’ll learn about that Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_0
TEXT: I just don’t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_1
TEXT: OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2
TEXT: According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3
TEXT: When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_4
TEXT: Be careful with this Pokémon when battling with it—that’s a lot of power you’re dealing with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5
TEXT: With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6
TEXT: Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. How’s your day?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_1
TEXT: Personally, mine is going swimmingly. Or perhaps…flappingly? You see, an enormous flock of Fletchling has gathered nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_2
TEXT: I heard some Pokémon chirping up a storm, so I went to investigate and found Fletchling as far as the eye can see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_3
TEXT: Fletchling is known as the Tiny Robin Pokémon, and it’s typically quite amiable and easy to train. Send it into battle, though, and you’ll quickly see its more ferocious side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_4
TEXT: A fascinating little Pokémon. But as glad as I am to see it here, it’s quite odd for so many to gather in one place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind conducting some research so we can better understand what’s going on?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer. Looks like you’ve got your very own Fletchling to join you on your journey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Fletchling’s body is always warm? In fact, Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with this Pokémon in their beds. How about that?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_2
TEXT: I’m always fascinated to learn about how Pokémon and their Trainers work and live together. And it never hurts to know how to cope on cold nights, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, Fletchling evolves into the Fire- and Flying-type Pokémon Fletchinder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_4
TEXT: Known as the Ember Pokémon, Fletchinder is exceedingly territorial and aggressive.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_5
TEXT: It’s also incredibly fast. Its speed from takeoff puts it easily among the fastest of all bird Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_6
TEXT: When you’re ready, why don’t you try evolving your Fletchling into Fletchinder? I’d love to witness that famous speed firsthand!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_0
TEXT: That’s a mighty fine Fletchinder you have there, %PLAYERNAME%. Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_1
TEXT: Naturally, I’ve been busy as well. In fact, I have some information you may find useful as you train Fletchinder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_2
TEXT: You see, Fletchinder is known to expel embers from its beak to set grass on fire. Then, it pounces on the bewildered prey that flee the flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_3
TEXT: Pretty intense, huh? Best not to wing it during training, if you catch my draft—er, drift.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_4
TEXT: Try not to let any fires Fletchinder starts get out of hand, too. We’re all responsible for caring for our environment, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_5
TEXT: With that said, there are still a few more tasks I’d like you to complete in aid of our research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_6
TEXT: Chief among those is to obtain a Talonflame, the evolution of Fletchinder. They’re said to have simply magnificent wings! Do you think you could evolve your Fletchinder, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%—and hello, Talonflame!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_1
TEXT: I know I’ve put you through your paces today, but it’s all paid off in the end! You’re now the proud Trainer of Talonflame, the Scorching Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_2
TEXT: Talonflame is known to shower embers from the gaps between its feathers during the heat of battle. It then takes to the air, reaching speeds of up to 310 mph.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_3
TEXT: Remember how I mentioned Talonflame’s wings before? Fire can’t pass through them, so they were used to outfit firefighters way back when.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_4
TEXT: Amazing stuff! I’m always impressed by this brave bird. The two of you will no doubt accomplish great things—and at great speeds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, Trainer. I hope you had as much fun as I did!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you! The strangest things have been happening lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_1
TEXT: You see, I begin each day with a Pinap Berry and coffee for breakfast, then head outside my lab to take in the crisp morning air before starting my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_2
TEXT: A couple days ago, however, I stepped outside and slipped on a sheet of ice right outside the entrance of my lab! Coffee—spilled. Pinap Berry—squished. Day—ruined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_3
TEXT: At first, I thought the ice formed because it was an especially chilly day, but it was in fact nowhere near cold enough to create a sheet of ice that thick!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_4
TEXT: For my sake—and my breakfast’s—can you help me research Ice-type Pokémon to see whether we can discover anything? *sniffle* My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve learned quite a bit about Ice-type Pokémon, and it looks as if you’ve caught a few interesting ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_1
TEXT: I feel like we’re getting closer to finding out the cause of my breakfast’s untimely demise. Oh! There’s something I forgot to mention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_2
TEXT: That very evening—after an incredibly sad, breakfast-less day—I was trying to cheer myself up by dressing in my comfiest pajamas and drinking a cup of herbal tea before tucking into bed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_3
TEXT: As I lay there, ready to count Mareep and fall asleep, I was suddenly awoken by some unnerving tapping outside my lab! It sounded like...tap-dancing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_4
TEXT: I was simply too comfortable in bed—and too frightened—to get up and check. All I could do was lie there and hope the tapping would end soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_5
TEXT: I now believe source of that tapping was the same Pokémon that created the sheet of ice in front of my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_6
TEXT: Can you investigate some Pokémon related to making peculiar sounds? Let’s see whether we can get closer to solving this case before it goes cold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_0
TEXT: ... ... ... OH! %PLAYERNAME%, you scared me. I was a bit distracted thinking about the tap-dancing I heard last night, as well as the shadow I saw pass by my window.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_1
TEXT: Oh, I didn’t mention that last part? Yes, it was quite an unnerving experience! Anyway, let me take a look at all the research you’ve done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_2
TEXT: Oh! OH! Oh my goodness! All right, I think I know the source of these strange occurrences now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_3
TEXT: I believe the culprit is the Galarian form of the Barrier Pokémon—Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_4
TEXT: Galarian Mr. Mime is known as the Dancing Pokémon. It likes to create a sheet of ice and tap-dance on it. What a strange Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_5
TEXT: While Galarian Mr. Mime is the prime suspect, it’s still just a hunch. Can you go out and do a bit more research to confirm? Maybe you might even come across a Galarian Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Great job catching that Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%! I guess it’s not as frightening as I first thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_1
TEXT: Perhaps it’ll become even more approachable when it evolves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Galarian Mr. Mime evolves into Mr. Rime, the Comedian Pokémon. Mr. Rime is apparently highly skilled at tap-dancing and waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_3
TEXT: I wonder whether it could teach me some new moves. Haha! Anyway, how about you try evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_0
TEXT: What a fascinating Pokémon Mr. Rime is! Thank you for evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_1
TEXT: I've heard stories of Mr. Rime’s amusing movements, and you know what? Color me amused. What a COOL discovery this was!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_2
TEXT: This has definitely been an unforgettable adventure, but I’m not sure I can say I’d do it again, given the chilling way it started. My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_3
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Excellent timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_1
TEXT: I just made a tremendously exciting discovery!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_2
TEXT: Earlier today, I was exploring a nearby cave to collect some samples when I noticed a peculiar warmth along one of the walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_3
TEXT: Suddenly, something jumped out and tried to bite me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_4
TEXT: I quickly realized I had stumbled upon a nest of Gible, the Land Shark Pokémon. Gible is known to react to anything that moves, so sometimes it leaps out and chomps passersby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_5
TEXT: I know it just wanted a nibble, but that’s a nibble too much in my book!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_6
TEXT: Anyway, it’s not every day you run into a gaggle of Gible. Do you think you could head out and do some research on their appearance here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_1
TEXT: While you were out tracking down the Land Shark Pokémon, I took a closer look at the cave I was telling you about earlier.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_2
TEXT: I was reminded of an interesting tidbit about Gible. It nests inside small, horizontal holes in cave walls warmed by geothermal heat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_3
TEXT: Gible seems to love warm places, and that cave certainly fits the bill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_4
TEXT: We’ve learned a lot about this Dragon- and Ground-type Pokémon, but there’s always more to discover!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_5
TEXT: When you’re ready, how about you try evolving your Gible into Gabite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_0
TEXT: Nice job evolving your Gible into Gabite, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_1
TEXT: Gabite is known as the Cave Pokémon, and it loves sparkly things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_2
TEXT: It emits ultrasonic waves from protrusions on either side of its head to probe pitch-dark caves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_3
TEXT: What a useful ability! Maybe it could help me avoid bumping into lab equipment in the middle of the night...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_4
TEXT: We’ve seen Gible and Gabite, but there’s still one more Evolution we need to document. Come see me when you’ve evolved your Gabite, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_0
TEXT: Ah! Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s an admirable Garchomp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_1
TEXT: Known as the Mach Pokémon, its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_2
TEXT: Those scales don’t just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent that touches them. Pretty spiffy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_3
TEXT: I think you’ll find Garchomp to be a powerful companion on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_4
TEXT: And I can’t wait to see how your relationship develops along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, Trainer. I hope you had a fin-tastic time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_1
TEXT: I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pokémon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_2
TEXT: We need to figure out what’s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_3
TEXT: Now that you’re here, I need you to be part of my Elite Research team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_4
TEXT: First things first—could you help survey the park and get some supplies?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_5
TEXT: Please complete the following research tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_0
TEXT: Yowzers! As you may have noticed, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena going on today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_1
TEXT: I’m not sure what could have caused it—they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_2
TEXT: Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_3
TEXT: The local Pokémon have become confused… It looks like they’re acting more aggressive and territorial!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_4
TEXT: Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pokémon to make the situation a bit more stable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_5
TEXT: Please catch some Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_0
TEXT: Well, it looks like there were some pretty powerful Pokémon causing the ruckus. Thanks for taking care of them! I'm sure they'll make great friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_1
TEXT: However, I'm not sure that was sufficient—the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pokémon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_2
TEXT: I've been seeing some unusual Pokémon called Unown floating around the area...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_3
TEXT: This Pokémon is shaped like ancient writing…and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pokémon—the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_4
TEXT: Let's do the following research tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_0
TEXT: Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_1
TEXT: I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_2
TEXT: Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_3
TEXT: It's a difficult task… We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_4
TEXT: The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_5
TEXT: These Pokémon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_6
TEXT: If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_7
TEXT: Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_8
TEXT: Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!
{0}
{1}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_0
TEXT: That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_1
TEXT: It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_2
TEXT: I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_3
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_4
TEXT: This weekend will be one to remember!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. Something odd is happening, and I need your help investigating it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_1
TEXT: While I was on a walk last night with my Buddy Pokémon, Meltan, I noticed a strange light flickering in my mobile lab. It was so spooky! One might’ve called it...a ghastly sight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_2
TEXT: Apparently, some Gastly were in my mobile lab hiding from the wind. It’s common for them to take shelter when massive gusts are blowing about so their gaseous bodies aren’t blown away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_3
TEXT: However, the sheer number of Gastly seemed unusual. They’re still in the mobile lab, so could you help me look into this situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were helping with our research, I was assisting the Gastly in the mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_1
TEXT: I had to be careful when I got near the Gastly. I didn’t want to be engulfed by their gaseous bodies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_2
TEXT: Now that the Gastly are out of the mobile lab, I think it’s time for us to start looking into Gastly’s Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_3
TEXT: I’ve done some reading on the matter, and I think we’ll need to prepare for a dangerous Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Seems as though your Gastly has evolved into Haunter. I had a feeling I was being watched.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_1
TEXT: It’s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it’s just being playful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_2
TEXT: I’ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don’t think Blanche is amused.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s go ahead and fix that problem by evolving Haunter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer. Your Haunter has now become the Shadow Pokémon, Gengar! Are you ready for a spooky story? Let me get my flashlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_1
TEXT: If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_2
TEXT: Do you feel that chill in the air? That means a Gengar is near. OOOoooOOOooo...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_3
TEXT: BOO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_4
TEXT: Hahaha, got you, %PLAYERNAME%! I crack myself up. Although...it looked for a second like there was a ghostly hand on your shoulder... Maybe it was just my imagination.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pokémon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it’s a fantastic Pokémon to have on your team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks to your help, I think we all learned something today! I’ll be in touch when I have another adventure for you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0
TEXT: BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1
TEXT: Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2
TEXT: Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3
TEXT: Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4
TEXT: Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5
TEXT: Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6
TEXT: Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0
TEXT: Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1
TEXT: What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2
TEXT: Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3
TEXT: After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4
TEXT: The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5
TEXT: Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0
TEXT: Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2
TEXT: I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3
TEXT: There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4
TEXT: One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6
TEXT: I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0
TEXT: Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_1
TEXT: Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2
TEXT: Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3
TEXT: All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4
TEXT: Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5
TEXT: I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_0
TEXT: Jessie: Hey, James, did you hear?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_1
TEXT: James: What is it, Jessie?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_2
TEXT: Jessie: Apparently, there’s a mysterious Pokémon in a jungle nearby!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_3
TEXT: James: Go on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_4
TEXT: Jessie: They say it’s called the Protector of the Jungle or something like that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_5
TEXT: James: Oh? That sounds like the kind of Pokémon the Boss would be happy to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_6
TEXT: Jessie: It’s going to be a pain, though, since we don’t really know the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_7
TEXT: James: Hmmm, maybe we can con someone into helping us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_8
TEXT: Jessie: Yeah... Huh? Hey, you! You must be an assistant the Boss sent! Yeah, why else would someone be out here in the middle of nowhere?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_9
TEXT: James: Assistant? Oh! Of course! An assistant! The Boss has high expectations for us, after all. Now that you’re here, let’s get to work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_0
TEXT: Jessie: Nice work, kid! I can’t believe you actually did it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_1
TEXT: James: Yeah! It feels nice to have somebody to boss around— I mean, uh, somebody to help us out! Jessie and I are constantly on our feet, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_2
TEXT: Jessie: As you can imagine, it’s hard for us to maintain our good looks when we’re always running around like this. Anyway, you did your bit, so I guess we can let you take a little break.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_3
TEXT: James: Superb idea, Jessie! It’s important to change up the pace every once in a while!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_4
TEXT: James: Go on and spend some time with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_0
TEXT: Jessie: I’m so glad the Boss sent along someone so useful to help us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_1
TEXT: James: Now that you mention it, you haven’t told us anything about yourself. Where are you normally stationed? How long have you been with Team Rocket? Oh, what’s your favorite thing about the Boss? Do tell!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_10
TEXT: James: Hey, who exactly are you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_11
TEXT: James: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_12
TEXT: Jessie: You’d better start talking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_13
TEXT: Jessie: Aha! I knew you were just a no-good Twerp! This whole thing was suspicious from the start! Did someone send you to get in our way?! Yeah, that must be it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_14
TEXT: James: I trusted you! I thought you were one of us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_15
TEXT: Jessie: You know too much! We can’t let you go! Let’s get ’em, James!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_16
TEXT: James: Don’t you dare get in our way! You’ll regret it if you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_17
TEXT: Jessie: Don’t you know who we are?! Well, let us formally introduce ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_18
TEXT: Jessie: Prepare for trouble...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_19
TEXT: James: And make it double!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_2
TEXT: Jessie: ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_20
TEXT: Jessie: To protect the world from devastation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_21
TEXT: James: To unite all people— HEY! Are you even listening?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_3
TEXT: James: Hey, why so quiet all of a sudden?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_4
TEXT: James: Jessie, who actually told you that we’d be getting an assistant?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_5
TEXT: Jessie: Nobody told ME anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_6
TEXT: James: Well, no one told me, either!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_7
TEXT: Jessie: But you’re the one who said they were sent by the Boss!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_8
TEXT: James: I said no such thing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_9
TEXT: James: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_0
TEXT: Jessie: I can’t believe we were defeated by a Twerp like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_1
TEXT: James: That was totally unexpected. What will the Boss say...?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_2
TEXT: James: Huh?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_3
TEXT: Jessie: Hey, behind you! Isn’t that Celebi? Could it be the so-called Protector of the Jungle?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_4
TEXT: James: Drat! That Pokémon was supposed to be ours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_5
TEXT: Jessie: Mark our words...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_6
TEXT: James: We’ll get you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_7
TEXT: Jessie: We’re blasting off again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Can I just say how impressed I am with your progress as a Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_1
TEXT: You’ve really put in the time and effort to become one of the very best. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_2
TEXT: Say, do you remember when we first met? You were just a beginner back then, and I sent you off to catch your very first Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_3
TEXT: And look at you now! I’m glad we can share that memory together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_4
TEXT: Now, I’m sure an elite Trainer like yourself has mastered the art of catching Pokémon, but it’s important to keep your skills sharp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_5
TEXT: How about you head out and catch some Pokémon? I’ve assigned some tasks that should challenge even a Trainer of your caliber.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_6
TEXT: Good luck—and have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_0
TEXT: Great work as always, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_1
TEXT: I’m sure those tasks were a breeze for someone with your skills, but they were just a warm-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_2
TEXT: These next tasks should prove a bit more challenging.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_3
TEXT: I’m sure you’ve built special bonds with several Pokémon over the course of your adventures. You might even have a few Pokémon that you like to always bring into battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_4
TEXT: I’d like to see how powerful those bonds are. Why don’t you head out, challenge a few Team GO Rocket Grunts, and battle in some raids?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_5
TEXT: After all, the best Trainers never stop training!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_6
TEXT: Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_0
TEXT: How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_1
TEXT: I’m sure you had a great time working with your closest Pokémon companions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_2
TEXT: It’s always fascinating to see how Trainers and Pokémon work together, and I can tell that you take a lot of pride in training your team. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_3
TEXT: Say, why don’t you evolve some of the Pokémon you’ve caught so they can reach their full potential? You might even discover some new options for battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_4
TEXT: Enough about that, though—back to our research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_5
TEXT: This next batch will test your Pokémon-catching skills again, but with a twist. Or perhaps I should say a curve? Haha! That’s right—you’ll need to test your skills with Curveball Throws!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_6
TEXT: Make sure to stretch your throwing arm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_0
TEXT: Nice work, Trainer! I can tell you put a lot of effort into that research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_1
TEXT: I have Blanche assisting me with the analysis and care of all those Pokémon you sent over. It’s an impressive display of your progress, Trainer, and it’s caught Blanche’s eye as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_2
TEXT: Anyway, I should probably get back to work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_3
TEXT: But before I go, I want to say how nice it was to reminisce about our first memories as professor and Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_4
TEXT: I’m truly proud of you and how much you’ve grown!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_5
TEXT: I know you’re far from finished on that front, too, so I’ll be watching closely as you progress and checking in whenever I have more challenges for you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_6
TEXT: Until then, %PLAYERNAME%...let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wanted to check in on your progress. It looks like you’ve grown even more as a Trainer since we last spoke!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_1
TEXT: As for me, I’ve been spending a lot of time with my Buddy Pokémon lately, and it’s helped me think of some new research opportunities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_2
TEXT: Do you remember your first Buddy Pokémon? I remember mine—it was the mysterious Hex Nut Pokémon Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_3
TEXT: I still remember the day it earned its very own Best Buddy ribbon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_4
TEXT: That’s a proud moment in any Trainer’s journey, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_5
TEXT: Meltan and I have been around the block a few times, but I still look forward to the next PokéStop we’ll visit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_6
TEXT: Why don’t you and your buddy go out and visit some of your favorite places together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_0
TEXT: Hope you enjoyed a few walks together with your buddy, Trainer. Did you come across any interesting PokéStops?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_1
TEXT: I was inspired to head outdoors myself. I joined Spark and his buddy for a long walk after he won a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_2
TEXT: I even took a celebratory snapshot to mark the occasion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_3
TEXT: Going on walks together can be a great way to strengthen your bond with your Pokémon. It’s also a wonderful form of exercise!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_4
TEXT: Seeing the bond Spark shares with his Pokémon gave me some ideas for more research. Oh, and Spark also wanted me to let you know that he’s cheering you on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_5
TEXT: How about you and your buddy go out for a walk, challenge another Trainer and their Pokémon to battle, and take a few snapshots to capture some fun moments together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_6
TEXT: Working hard is important, but so is savoring the memories made along the way! Have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_0
TEXT: Did you make any fun memories with your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_1
TEXT: I’m always amazed by the variety in the snapshots taken by Trainers from all over the world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_2
TEXT: I’m especially fond of ones that capture surprise encounters with Pokémon like Smeargle!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_3
TEXT: That’s one of the best parts of taking snapshots—you never know what you’re going to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_4
TEXT: Hmm... That reminds me of when Team GO Rocket decided to start showing up in Trainers’ snapshots uninvited. And THAT reminds me of some more research I need your help with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_5
TEXT: To start, why don’t you and your buddy get warmed up with some raids? When you’re ready, I think we’ll need some help clearing out the Team GO Rocket Leaders in the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_6
TEXT: They’re always up to something, so it’s good to keep an eye out in case they try to take over any nearby PokéStops. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_1
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders are a challenge for most Trainers, but I knew they wouldn’t stand a chance against you and your Buddy Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_2
TEXT: The power of friendship is strong indeed—and just one of many benefits to building relationships with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_3
TEXT: The trust between a Trainer and their Pokémon is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Make sure to cherish it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_4
TEXT: I’m glad I was able to check in on your progress, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_5
TEXT: I’ll be back with more fun challenges as you continue your journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_6
TEXT: Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_1
TEXT: I can see you’ve been working as hard as ever!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_2
TEXT: We’ve been doing a lot of reminiscing lately, haven’t we? I think it’s important to look back on your accomplishments from time to time—especially when you’ve accomplished so much!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_3
TEXT: A major moment for many Trainers is their first victory in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_4
TEXT: It’s an unforgettable thrill that comes with a swell of pride for the Pokémon that sealed the victory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_5
TEXT: How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m sure you’ve got some epic battle stories to share with your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_6
TEXT: I’d like to focus on your battling skills for this next challenge. So to prepare, why don’t you get your team sorted and get in some throwing practice?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_0
TEXT: You clearly have some powerful Pokémon, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_1
TEXT: You’ve done an amazing job training them! I wanted to see how your battling skills have progressed, so I consulted with Candela to get her thoughts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_2
TEXT: I’m happy to report that she’s just as proud of you as I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_3
TEXT: For this next challenge, she suggested taking on some of her most difficult opponents—Team GO Rocket and its leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders can be intimidating, so Candela asked me to pass along some extra guidance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_5
TEXT: She said that when it comes to battling, you should take on your opponents with a cool head, strong Pokémon, and a heart full of passion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_6
TEXT: With that in mind, I think it’s time for you to head out and put your skills to the test!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your battling skills are even more impressive than the last time we talked.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_1
TEXT: Those skills are vital not only when you take on Team GO Rocket but also when you battle in raids. Do you remember your first raid, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_2
TEXT: To me, there’s something special about a group of Trainers coming together to challenge a raid with their partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_3
TEXT: There’s no questioning the importance of the bonds Trainers share with their Pokémon, but I think the bonds Trainers share with their peers are equally important.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_4
TEXT: No matter your skill level, what team you’re on, or the Pokémon you bring to battle, raids are about each Trainer working together to achieve a common goal. And that’s what the Trainer community is all about!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_5
TEXT: I hope that inspired you to head out and challenge some raids with your fellow Trainers—because that’s part of your next task!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_6
TEXT: It should be a fun challenge, so be sure to give it your best shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_1
TEXT: Did you enjoy spending time with your fellow Trainers as you completed your tasks?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_2
TEXT: Hopefully you even found a Pokémon that’ll make a great addition to your team!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_3
TEXT: I hope you continue making memories with Trainers from all over as you work together and explore this amazing world filled with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_4
TEXT: Very few Trainers have made it as far as you have. Be sure to take a moment to celebrate your progress.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_5
TEXT: And remember—the journey is just as important as the destination!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_6
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_0
TEXT: I knew I’d see you here before long, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_1
TEXT: But before we begin this challenge, let’s take a couple deep breaths together, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_2
TEXT: In... And out... One more time. In... And out... There, that’s better.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_3
TEXT: A few deep breaths go a long way when you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand—and you’ll need plenty of focus for what I’ll be throwing your way next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_4
TEXT: Get it? “Throwing”? Ahem! Anyway... The sign of a truly great Trainer is their dedication to training, and true dedication takes time to prove.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_5
TEXT: Your next few tasks will take some time to complete, but don’t worry. Start with a deep breath, and be sure to enjoy yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_6
TEXT: Training can be hard work, but don’t forget it’s supposed to be fun, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_0
TEXT: Impressive work, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_1
TEXT: I don’t know many who would have the dedication and patience to complete those tasks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_2
TEXT: Say, I was just thinking... Do you remember when you decided which team you wanted to join?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_3
TEXT: Trainers often form a strong connection to their team and become dedicated members. Others, however, eventually look to change teams in hopes of gaining a different perspective and a fresh challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_4
TEXT: Everyone’s path is different, and I’ll always encourage you to find your own. There’s much to be learned from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, and Team Valor. Each team has its own unique characteristics and focus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_5
TEXT: I urge you to learn from your fellow Trainers and respect their paths. It’s sure to help you become a better Trainer! After all, only when we understand others can we truly understand ourselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_6
TEXT: Now, back to your research. I have a feeling this next batch will truly test your resolve, so take your time—we’ll regroup when you’re finished!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. You certainly showed your dedication by completing those tasks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_1
TEXT: Which did you find most difficult? And which was most fun?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_2
TEXT: We’re approaching the end of this challenge, and I’m not ashamed to say it’s making me a bit emotional! The team leaders and I feel an immense sense of pride when we see how much you’ve grown.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_3
TEXT: I hope you feel that pride in yourself, %PLAYERNAME%. To wrap up this challenge, each team leader wanted you to experience some of their most beloved activities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_4
TEXT: Spark wants you to enjoy a walk with your buddy to enhance your bond, and Blanche hopes to remind you of the importance of research and analysis by asking you to evolve some of your Pokémon to their full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_5
TEXT: As for Candela... Well, she wants to celebrate with you after you win some raids.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_6
TEXT: I think these are great tasks for a well-rounded Trainer like yourself. I’ll be here to congratulate you when you’re done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_0
TEXT: Amazing. Simply amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! Let me be the first to congratulate you for completing this challenge. You’ve become a truly top-class Trainer, and it’s been an honor to work alongside you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_1
TEXT: It’s been astonishing to witness the growth you’ve experienced since you began your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. You’re an incredible talent, and I hope you’ll put your skills to use.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_2
TEXT: You see, I want you to help other Trainers become the best they can be. Your experience comes with a lot of responsibility, and I hope you’ll continue to show kindness, patience, and friendship to those who could benefit from your guidance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_3
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is a beautiful place, and I want you to lead by example and show everyone how amazing our community can be while protecting it from the likes of Team GO Rocket and anyone else who would threaten it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_4
TEXT: Remember how it felt the first time you caught a Pokémon, the first time you took a walk with your buddy, the first time you challenged a raid—and channel that energy into everything you do. With your strong heart and peerless determination, there’s nothing you can’t do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_5
TEXT: I can only hope you’re as proud of yourself as the team leaders and I are of you. Don’t worry—I’ll always be here when you need me, and you can be sure I’ll be calling on you from time to time to help me with research. There’s always something more to discover, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_6
TEXT: Thanks for everything, %PLAYERNAME%. I know I can always count on you! And I’m sure you know what I’m about to say, so before I get too choked up—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_0
TEXT: ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_1
TEXT: Oh! %PLAYERNAME%, you caught me by surprise. I was just thinking about some movies I’ve seen recently.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_2
TEXT: What, you didn’t take me for a movie guy? Haha! Well, while the world of Pokémon is my greatest passion, I’ve been trying to explore my interests outside of research and Pokémon as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_3
TEXT: Self-discovery is important for personal growth in all walks of life. It can also be quite fun! I’ve learned that I really enjoy watching a film to pass the time now and again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_4
TEXT: Also, a lot of movies feature Pokémon! Don’t you love it when your interests overlap?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_5
TEXT: I saw an incredibly thrilling action movie the other day. It was about a fighter who, against all odds, becomes a professional boxer alongside his trusty Machop.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_6
TEXT: Life had him on the ropes, but he just kept punching back! Talk about inspiring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_7
TEXT: Did you know that Machop love to work out and build their muscles? They’re never satisfied, even when they train hard all day long! I wish I had that energy when I do fieldwork!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_8
TEXT: Speaking of Machop: Did you notice that more of them are appearing in the wild? That’s what reminded me of that movie in the first place!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_9
TEXT: Could you head out and learn more about Machop?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job catching all those Machop. I wonder if you’ll grow as close as the two characters in that movie.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_1
TEXT: The main character started in a pretty tough place, but his Machop kept him motivated and inspired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_2
TEXT: Then, he was given an incredible opportunity to compete against other fighters. My favorite part was when his Machop evolved into Machoke!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t the relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon wonderful? Machoke are truly remarkable Pokémon, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_4
TEXT: A Machoke’s muscular body is so powerful, the Pokémon must wear a power-save belt to regulate its motions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_5
TEXT: As it happens, you should have enough Machop Candies now to evolve Machop into a Machoke of your own. It’s almost like you’re living out that movie yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_0
TEXT: Wow—that’s one muscular Machoke! Great work evolving it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_1
TEXT: Sometimes, Machoke will head to fields and mountains to exercise and train. Isn’t that dedication amazing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_2
TEXT: It reminds me of a training montage in that film. The Trainer and his Machoke traveled to the mountains to train together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_3
TEXT: Watching their friendship blossom almost moved me to tears! The way they encouraged each other reminded me why I love Pokémon, especially when the Machoke evolved into Machamp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_4
TEXT: Oops, there I go again… Anyway, Machop and Machoke are very impressive Pokémon, but Machamp is on an entirely different level.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_5
TEXT: Its four arms react more quickly than it can think, so Machamp can execute several punches at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_6
TEXT: Hoo-hah! That was the movie Machamp’s signature move. Haha, who knew I’d become such a film buff? Get it? Buff?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_7
TEXT: Moving right along…

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_8
TEXT: How about you do a bit of research on Machamp? Your Machoke seems pumped to get stronger. Let’s try evolving it into Machamp and see what happens!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you approaching with your newly evolved Machamp, and I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. It was just like the end of that movie!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_1
TEXT: The Trainer ended up winning the tournament, and he couldn’t have done it without his Machamp by his side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_2
TEXT: Movies are so powerful! Especially ones about Pokémon and their Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_3
TEXT: I suppose you and Machamp don’t need to watch that particular film, though—you practically lived it today! It’s been inspiring to witness, and I hope to carry that inspiration with me as I grow closer to my own Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_4
TEXT: You never know what you’ll discover about yourself when you try new things—just like how you never know which Pokémon you’ll end up forming a lifelong friendship with until you catch them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for coming along with me on this journey, Trainer. I wish you and your Machamp well, and I’ll see you next time. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Do you hear that sound?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_1
TEXT: All morning, I’ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it’s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_2
TEXT: Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_3
TEXT: Guess it’s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_4
TEXT: Anyway, I think it’ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they’re harmless.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_5
TEXT: However, I see potential in this Pokémon. It’s time to head out and investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that’s something I’d like to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_2
TEXT: Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pokémon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_3
TEXT: I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don’t you think? Let’s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_4
TEXT: Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they’re quite useful as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_0
TEXT: Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you’ve completed, it’s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_1
TEXT: Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn’t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_3
TEXT: So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type—something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_4
TEXT: Looks like you’ll be adding a powerful Pokémon to your team, but let’s proceed with caution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you’ve got yourself a Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_1
TEXT: I’m sure this Pokémon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_2
TEXT: Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_3
TEXT: I’m excited to see what kinds of challenges you’ll demolish together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_4
TEXT: Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles—not entire cities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2
TEXT: Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3
TEXT: There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4
TEXT: I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5
TEXT: Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6
TEXT: Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1
TEXT: As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2
TEXT: My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4
TEXT: When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5
TEXT: And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6
TEXT: As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0
TEXT: You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1
TEXT: Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2
TEXT: Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3
TEXT: Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4
TEXT: There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got your very own Magmortar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_1
TEXT: Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_2
TEXT: Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_3
TEXT: Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_4
TEXT: See you around, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1
TEXT: Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2
TEXT: After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_3
TEXT: It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4
TEXT: I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5
TEXT: After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6
TEXT: It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7
TEXT: Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1
TEXT: Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2
TEXT: My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3
TEXT: It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4
TEXT: It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5
TEXT: Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6
TEXT: Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0
TEXT: Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1
TEXT: I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2
TEXT: While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3
TEXT: Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4
TEXT: Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6
TEXT: I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0
TEXT: I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1
TEXT: I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2
TEXT: I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4
TEXT: I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5
TEXT: In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_6
TEXT: However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_7
TEXT: You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_8
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s always great to see you! I’m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_1
TEXT: That’s why I’ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I’ll be asking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_2
TEXT: I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pokémon that has really sent me and other Pokémon researchers into quite a tizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_3
TEXT: Can you believe an undiscovered Pokémon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_4
TEXT: I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don’t worry, though... I’m sure the repairs won’t cost me too much at the shop...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_5
TEXT: Although each Pokémon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn’t put a damper on my day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_6
TEXT: So many Ditto taking on this unique Pokémon form must mean that the real Pokémon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_7
TEXT: Let’s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don’t have much to go on, but I’m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_8
TEXT: But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you’ll gather in the field.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_1
TEXT: While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pokémon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn’t have much luck.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_2
TEXT: But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pokémon has been unseen until just recently, I think it’s safe to say that we’re tracking another Mythical Pokémon, like Mew and Celebi.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_3
TEXT: If I’m right and this elusive Pokémon is a Mythical Pokémon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_4
TEXT: But let’s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_5
TEXT: Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I’m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_6
TEXT: Please complete the following tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pokémon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it—don’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_1
TEXT: Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_2
TEXT: What luck! Did you know that when Professor Oak was my instructor, he was my role model? And he still is!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_3
TEXT: He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pokémon, so I really think we’re on to something!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_4
TEXT: Still, a name alone isn’t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don’t?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_5
TEXT: I think that if we find Ditto, we’ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_6
TEXT: Observation will be the best way forward, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_7
TEXT: Please complete the following tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you’ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_1
TEXT: This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn’t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_2
TEXT: But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_3
TEXT: In order to make more progress, I think we should study these types of Pokémon! Can you complete the following tasks?
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_0
TEXT: Great news, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to all the data you’ve collected, I was able to make a detailed study of the differences between Electric-type Pokémon and Steel-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_1
TEXT: Thankfully, the Ditto was able to use Transform one more time! It took me some time to figure out it was attracted to all my metal equipment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_2
TEXT: Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto’s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_3
TEXT: I can now say that, according to my research, Meltan is a Steel-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_4
TEXT: I think our next step is to study more Pokémon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pokémon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_5
TEXT: {0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_6
TEXT: Oh, and one more thing—Professor Oak is also studying a Ditto in his own lab that is able to Transform into Meltan. With our parallel research, I think we’ll be able to make some breakthroughs soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_7

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_0
TEXT: Just in the nick of time, %PLAYERNAME%! With careful study of the Ditto that I sent him and the small amount of documented Meltan encounters, Professor Oak was able to solve more mysteries related to this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_1
TEXT: Meltan very well may have split from a Pokémon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pokémon that can divide into multiple, independent Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_2
TEXT: This explains why the world saw a simultaneous appearance of so many Ditto disguised as Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_3
TEXT: Professor Oak and I have made a guess as to how Meltan can re-form back into Melmetal—because Meltan have bodies similar to molten metal, they have a unique ability to merge and trigger an Evolution into Melmetal!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_4
TEXT: Do you know what Pokémon we should research next? You’re bright, %PLAYERNAME%, so I know you know the answer! I need you to collect data on Pokémon for which several parts can come together and act as one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_0
TEXT: Wow, I’m impressed! %PLAYERNAME%! Your data has arrived just as I’ve finished putting pieces of evidence together to learn Melmetal’s place in history.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_1
TEXT: According to these records, Melmetal was once regarded as a sacred being in a secluded community deep inside a wooded land that was rich with magnetite-bearing sedimentary rock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_2
TEXT: People there developed ways to make unique tools out of metal shed by Melmetal. Without such metal, they couldn’t have made these tools back then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_0
TEXT: I just received an important piece of news, %PLAYERNAME%! Remember the ancient text? It seems that a mysterious box was also excavated from the same site where the ancient text was found.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_1
TEXT: There was nothing in the box except a rusty lump of metal that bears interesting similarities to Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_2
TEXT: Perhaps exposing the box to this vast natural environment could cause something enigmatic to happen, resulting in Meltan changing states as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_3
TEXT: Exposing this metal to the open air could have had an entirely different effect on what’s inside the box, but we won’t know until we try it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_4
TEXT: We may be able to find a clue about the lump of metal by delving into the world of ancient Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_0
TEXT: I was right, %PLAYERNAME%! This artifact is truly Meltan! We did it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_1
TEXT: Of course, the reason for Meltan’s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pokémon somehow split itself apart.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_2
TEXT: Doing so could have been thought of as the only way for the people to ever meet Melmetal again. That warms the heart a little, doesn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_3
TEXT: Make sure you give Meltan plenty of chances to see the vast world we live in by venturing out and exploring! Who knows what will happen from here...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_1
TEXT: A Pokémon found in a jungle far to the south that was thought to have been extinct. It is so rare that many experts say that it is a myth. %BREAK%Only a few people have seen it worldwide. Apparently, it appears only to those people who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_2
TEXT: My colleagues in Kanto, including my instructor, Professor Oak, spent a long time studying Mew. It looks like our findings match theirs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_3
TEXT: According to our research, Mew was said to be observed using moves of all kinds. This observation has led some of us to say that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_2
TEXT: Yes, it looks like Mew has visited your area recently! Hmm... Interesting. If that's the case, someone should have reported a sighting...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_7_2
TEXT: My assistants and I will request some Special Research from you in the future. Stay in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again! I’m always grateful to have a helping hand with my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_1
TEXT: Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_2
TEXT: Well, I’m not entirely sure why, but Porygon have been appearing more frequently in the area as of late!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_3
TEXT: I’d like to take this opportunity to learn more about this odd Pokémon. How about it, Trainer? Will you go out and catch some Porygon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_1
TEXT: I was able to review the data you collected, and I discovered that Porygon is made entirely of programming code!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_2
TEXT: Other reports I dug up mention that it was created by a group of scientists using state-of-the-art technology. Can you believe it? A man-made Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_3
TEXT: Porygon have made a name for themselves by protecting cyberspace from suspicious activity! For something artificial, they sure do seem caring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_4
TEXT: Maybe I should keep a Porygon around in case Team GO Rocket tries a digital take-over...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_5
TEXT: Well, in the meantime, I’d like to learn more about Porygon’s evolved form, Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_6
TEXT: I have a hunch that you’ll need to use an Upgrade to evolve Porygon. Let's get back out there and see if we can't find one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts, I’ve realized just how different Porygon2 is from Porygon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_2
TEXT: According to my findings, further research and the implementation of artificial intelligence into its code allowed Porygon2 to develop the ability to learn independent of its programming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_3
TEXT: The power of science is just astounding, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_4
TEXT: These reports also mention that Porygon2 was upgraded to enable extraterrestrial exploration and planetary development, though it has yet to accomplish much.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_5
TEXT: I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_6
TEXT: For your next batch of research, I want you to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z using a Sinnoh Stone. Good luck out there, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats on evolving your Porygon2 into a Porygon-Z, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_1
TEXT: I’ve uncovered some notes about this Pokémon that I thought you’d find interesting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_2
TEXT: According to reports, an update was added to Porygon-Z’s programming that was supposed to allow it to move between dimensions. But the upgrade also caused Porygon-Z to become unstable, and it began behaving erratically.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_3
TEXT: Because the update caused instability, academics can’t seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_4
TEXT: It’s going to take a bit of time to file away all this research, but I’m thrilled we were able to learn more about Porygon and its Evolutions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_5
TEXT: Your hard work is always appreciated, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I’m in need of another inquisitive eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_0
TEXT: Hi, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m glad to see you! Can I get your help with investigating something?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_1
TEXT: I’ve noticed an alarming number of reports from Trainers who have found PokéStops that look...discolored?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_2
TEXT: Some Trainers have even spotted people wearing shirts with a big letter R on them who are guarding these PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_3
TEXT: These shady characters appear to have Pokémon with a mysterious dark aura around them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_4
TEXT: As I investigate this with Spark, it might be best to power up some of your Pokémon. You never know what we might encounter...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_0
TEXT: Great job strengthening your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_1
TEXT: After visiting one of the PokéStops with Spark, we were challenged to a Trainer Battle by someone who belongs to an organization called Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_2
TEXT: Turns out that Team GO Rocket has been stealing resources from PokéStops with the help of Pokémon that are cloaked in a dark aura. They’re called Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_3
TEXT: Luckily, we won the battle, and afterward, Team GO Rocket carelessly abandoned their defeated Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_4
TEXT: Help us protect local PokéStops from Team GO Rocket, Trainer! As you do so, please save any Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket abandons!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for all your hard work, %PLAYERNAME%! Candela and I have done some research on Shadow Pokémon and learned some very unsettling things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_1
TEXT: While Pokémon naturally become stronger through training, these Shadow Pokémon seem to have been overpowered through unnatural means.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_2
TEXT: As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_3
TEXT: But don’t worry! It looks like we can help them harness this strength through a process called purification.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_4
TEXT: Can you help me purify some Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_0
TEXT: WOW! Thanks for helping us learn more about the Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket uses, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_1
TEXT: After observing the purification process with Blanche, it’s clear that the Pokémon’s gratefulness to you for purifying them causes the move Frustration to be replaced with Return!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_2
TEXT: Now that you have this knowledge, we need your help with saving as many Shadow Pokémon as possible by taking back PokéStops that are under Team GO Rocket’s control!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_3
TEXT: The world is under attack! Can we count on you to help protect it? I do hope there’s nothing more to this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help in defeating Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been observing Team GO Rocket, and something tells us this is far from over.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_2
TEXT: The transmission sent during the Team GO Rocket take-over had a message from an unknown sender at the end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_3
TEXT: We’re going to need all the help we can get to reveal the identity of this unknown figure looming in the shadows, and you are just the Trainer for the job!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_4
TEXT: Can you help us get to the bottom of this mystery?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for your continued support against those pesky Team GO Rocket Grunts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_1
TEXT: As they flee, some Grunts are leaving behind Mysterious Components.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_2
TEXT: I believe these are what Team GO Rocket is using to hack and steal resources from PokéStops. Clever little devices, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_3
TEXT: There’s information we can glean from these components that will help us in our fight against this dangerous organization.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_4
TEXT: Once you have enough pieces, you should be able to assemble something similar to the device I’ve modified in my lab. It might be best to prepare yourself for whatever might come, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_0
TEXT: Interesting. It appears there’s more to Team GO Rocket than previously thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_1
TEXT: Their ingenuity has got me thinking there might be another use for these Mysterious Components. We shouldn’t underestimate Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_2
TEXT: It’s time to get battle ready, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_3
TEXT: I don’t want to send you out to face another foe without some more training.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_4
TEXT: While you sharpen your battle skills, I’ll be sure to get this little project of mine up and operational.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer. I’ve been working on a prototype for something I call the Rocket Radar, but I was missing some critical components.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_1
TEXT: Your hard work in retrieving these components actually made my device work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_2
TEXT: If we combine my research and these Mysterious Components you’ve found, we can create a radar-like tool to track down Team GO Rocket Hideouts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_3
TEXT: Trainers all over the world are figuring out how to put together devices like this, and they’re identifying more hideouts than I originally anticipated.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_4
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to head to these hideouts and face whatever—or whomever—is there head on. Let’s GO.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_0
TEXT: You battled well, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve done your team leaders—and me—proud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_1
TEXT: According to my observations, it appears the sender of that mysterious transmission during the Team GO Rocket take-over was not in attendance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_2
TEXT: There’s someone else calling the shots—someone above Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_3
TEXT: I’ve improved on my previous invention and put together a Super Rocket Radar that should help you track this mastermind down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_4
TEXT: If it is who I think it is, he signs all his messages with “G.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_1
TEXT: You’ve put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s plans for the time being and rescued a special Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_2
TEXT: It’s unlikely that Giovanni will give up this easily, so I hope we can rely on you to take down Team GO Rocket members as they appear around your area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_3
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela will be on the lookout as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_4
TEXT: I’m sure Team GO Rocket will try to hatch another villainous plot soon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help holding back Team GO Rocket’s forces. It’s good to know I can rely on you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_1
TEXT: However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_2
TEXT: We need to think long-term about our strategy when it comes to Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_3
TEXT: I want to make sure only the most-prepared Trainers are equipped with Super Rocket Radar devices to track Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_4
TEXT: I know you’re an accomplished Trainer, but let’s make sure your skills are keeping up with the challenge Team GO Rocket poses.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_1
TEXT: You know how purifying Shadow Pokémon makes them stronger afterward due to the gratitude they feel toward you for saving them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_2
TEXT: Maybe one of the Pokémon you purify will become a trusted partner in our efforts to fight against Team GO Rocket’s invasion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_3
TEXT: We need to continue saving and purifying these Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_0
TEXT: Fantastic! Good work purifying all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. They’re practically glowing with gratitude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_2
TEXT: One of my favorite sights is a Purified Pokémon standing proud atop a Gym controlled by its Trainer’s team. It’s truly a thing to behold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_3
TEXT: It’s time for you and your new friends to train alongside one another.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_0
TEXT: You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I are certainly proud of how much you’ve grown as a Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_2
TEXT: I have one final task for you before I can be sure your skills are keeping up with an opponent like Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_3
TEXT: If you can show me that you can still defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_4
TEXT: then I’ll know that you and your Pokémon are in top form.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_0
TEXT: Your skills are as impressive as ever. It’s time for you to take a Super Rocket Radar and see if you can track down the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I think you’re ready to take on Giovanni again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_2
TEXT: You’ve proven your strength in battle, and you’ve also shown your compassion by saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_3
TEXT: So get out there and confront Giovanni. With loyal Pokémon at your side and lots of experience under your belt, you’re unstoppable!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! You should enjoy your victory, of course, but it looks like our work isn’t done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_1
TEXT: While you were busy, I was doing some reconnaissance. I have to admit, it’s been quite thrilling!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_2
TEXT: As you might have guessed, there are many more hideouts and headquarters out there that the Team GO Rocket Leaders and Giovanni could be hiding in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_3
TEXT: We may have defeated them for the moment, but I’m sure they’ll be back and causing more trouble soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_1
TEXT: It’s time to head out and show those Team GO Rocket Leaders that we’re strong enough to hold our own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_2
TEXT: We can’t let these bullies get in our way when we’re saving Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_0
TEXT: Fantastic work. Have you noticed, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_1
TEXT: There seems to be a trend behind which Pokémon Giovanni is turning into Shadow Pokémon. I’m thinking about the fact that he has Legendary Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_2
TEXT: Could that have anything to do with why he’s here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_3
TEXT: In any case, the time has come to track him down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_4
TEXT: The more we battle Giovanni and his team of Grunts, the more we learn about why he’s waging these take-overs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_0
TEXT: You’ve shown what it takes to be a true Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_1
TEXT: Your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, but the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_2
TEXT: Keep your eyes open, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_3
TEXT: Giovanni does not like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon, trying to further his plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_4
TEXT: I’m sure I can count on you when he returns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help battling Team GO Rocket. Trainers like you help keep Pokémon safe!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_1
TEXT: But this battle is far from over, and we must continue learning about Team GO Rocket, their leaders, and their boss, Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_2
TEXT: Looks like the Rocket Radar I developed is helping the cause. I remember when this strange activity started happening...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_3
TEXT: Back then, I had a hunch the Mysterious Components that Team GO Rocket Grunts were leaving behind held more secrets than we originally thought. We’ve come quite a long way since then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_4
TEXT: On that note, could you continue your work battling Grunts and helping Shadow Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_1
TEXT: I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pokémon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_2
TEXT: As a Pokémon Professor, I always want to contribute and help where I can. I may not be an accomplished battler like you, %PLAYERNAME%, but I can use my skills as a researcher and scientist to assist you on your journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_3
TEXT: That was why I started using Mysterious Components to build the prototype for the Rocket Radar. I hoped that Trainers like you could use it in our ongoing fight against Team GO Rocket and in our efforts to rescue more Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_4
TEXT: So let’s get out there and do just that. I’m grateful for your help, especially now. It’s when times are toughest that we have the greatest opportunity to shine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for purifying those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they are just as grateful as I am for your dedication.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_1
TEXT: Rescuing these Pokémon was the main reason for my work on the Rocket Radar prototype.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_2
TEXT: Luckily, with the help of the team leaders and motivated Trainers like you, we were able to develop a functioning Rocket Radar and even start work on the Super Rocket Radar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_3
TEXT: While a terrible situation, the Team GO Rocket invasion has been a thrilling adventure and research opportunity. I’m anxious but excited to send our findings over to my mentor, Professor Oak. I’ll be sure to let him know you said hello!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_4
TEXT: Now, it’s time to get back to work. Let’s test your battle skills, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_0
TEXT: I’m always so impressed when Trainers use supereffective moves in battle. It’s a sign of greatness when you see a Trainer using type effectiveness to their advantage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_1
TEXT: All our work lately seems to have gotten Team GO Rocket’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_2
TEXT: Reports are coming in that Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo are currently lurking in the area. You know what to do, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_0
TEXT: I knew you could do it, %PLAYERNAME%. The more you practice, the better you’ll be able to take on those pesky Team GO Rocket Leaders. I’m sure they’re already scheming up their next plan after this defeat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_1
TEXT: But now, Giovanni is waiting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_2
TEXT: Using the Super Rocket Radar, track him down and defeat him. We must remain strong—Giovanni is relentless. I wonder why he continues his invasion...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_3
TEXT: There are so many resources and Pokémon in our world. His evil plans must have something to do with that. My research will continue, but we need you to face him.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re counting on you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_1
TEXT: I will definitely be adding your victory as a note to the research I send over to Professor Oak.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_2
TEXT: I’m sure he will be interested in anything you’ve learned about Shadow Pokémon and the continuing Team GO Rocket invasion, so please keep up your research and send it my way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_3
TEXT: It may seem small, but every little bit helps!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_4
TEXT: I’ll be in touch soon, since we know Team GO Rocket isn’t likely to go anywhere. I know you’ll be ready for whatever happens next!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket’s forces.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_1
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, we’ve learned so much about this enemy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so I’m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_3
TEXT: While you’ve done an amazing job so far, I’m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_4
TEXT: The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn’t be a good Professor if I didn’t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_0
TEXT: As expected, %PLAYERNAME%. Fantastic work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_1
TEXT: Even though we’ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I’m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pokémon keep appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_2
TEXT: It seems even more Pokémon are being turned into Shadow Pokémon despite our efforts. I’ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_3
TEXT: We need to keep pushing forward—those Pokémon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_4
TEXT: I’m sure you’ll see them shine with gratitude once you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_1
TEXT: I’m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pokémon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_2
TEXT: Your talent has made it clear that you’re ready for the next step in your preparations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_3
TEXT: Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you’re at your best!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_0
TEXT: All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_1
TEXT: Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I’m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_2
TEXT: Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they’re holed up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete—you’re ready to take on Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_1
TEXT: It’s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_2
TEXT: You’ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_3
TEXT: Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won’t be able to stop you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_1
TEXT: Although your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_2
TEXT: But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_3
TEXT: Giovanni doesn’t like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon to further his plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_4
TEXT: I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I’ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_0
TEXT: Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I’ve given you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_1
TEXT: Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_2
TEXT: But there are so many aspects to Pokémon training! I think it’s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pokémon Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_3
TEXT: Why not take a walk with your buddy Pokémon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_4
TEXT: And be sure to rescue Shadow Pokémon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pokémon still need our help!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_1
TEXT: I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pokémon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche’s research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_2
TEXT: Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they’re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pokémon in danger.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_3
TEXT: While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_4
TEXT: I’m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won’t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket’s leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_1
TEXT: I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_2
TEXT: Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_3
TEXT: Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_0
TEXT: You’ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_1
TEXT: You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_2
TEXT: Great work. Now it’s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_3
TEXT: Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pokémon have certainly not gone unnoticed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_4
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket’s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_0
TEXT: Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_1
TEXT: One interesting thing to note is that I’ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pokémon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_2
TEXT: This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pokémon if they’ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_3
TEXT: There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_4
TEXT: For now, I need you to focus. It’s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_0
TEXT: What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_1
TEXT: Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I’m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_2
TEXT: You’ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn’t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_3
TEXT: But we can’t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket’s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_4
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_1
TEXT: What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_2
TEXT: We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_3
TEXT: What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_1
TEXT: As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_2
TEXT: We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_3
TEXT: More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_0
TEXT: Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_1
TEXT: I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_2
TEXT: While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_3
TEXT: It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1
TEXT: While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_2
TEXT: It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_3
TEXT: First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_4
TEXT: This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1
TEXT: I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1_alt
TEXT: I managed to build another Super Rocket Radar to help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—Blanche and Candela’s reports revealed that Giovanni has got a Legendary Shadow Pokémon with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2
TEXT: You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2_alt
TEXT: You need to save it, Trainer! I have no doubt Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon to nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_3
TEXT: You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_0
TEXT: Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1
TEXT: Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1_alt
TEXT: Not only did you stop Team GO Rocket, but you also saved several Pokémon along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_2
TEXT: This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sorry to call you here so suddenly, but I’m afraid there’s trouble afoot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_1
TEXT: That’s right—Team GO Rocket is up to no good! We’re not sure what their plan is just yet, but we know we have to stop them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_2
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You did a tremendous job defeating those Team GO Rocket Grunts and saving those poor Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_1
TEXT: While you were busy battling, I received reports that Team GO Rocket has obtained a Flying-type Legendary Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_2
TEXT: Blanche is doing recon as we speak in hopes of figuring out exactly which Legendary Pokémon we’re dealing with. I have no doubt we’ll have more information soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_3
TEXT: While we wait, why don’t you conduct some research on Flying-type Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for catching all those Flying-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_1
TEXT: Blanche and I have been analyzing them to help us learn more about the Legendary Pokémon that Team GO Rocket captured.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_2
TEXT: Unfortunately, our current hypothesis points to this Pokémon being one that’s near and dear to the team leaders’ hearts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_3
TEXT: While we gather more information, could you head back out into the field? We can’t let Team GO Rocket continue its plan unopposed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. I see you’ve got yourself a Pidgeot and some Pidgeot Mega Energy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_1
TEXT: As impressive as this Pokémon is, though, it doesn’t seem to be the Flying-type Pokémon we've heard about in our reports.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_2
TEXT: Blanche’s latest intel points to Giovanni being the one holding on to this mysterious Flying-type Legendary Pokémon, so we need to track him down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_3
TEXT: We believe our best bet at doing so is by first finding the Team GO Rocket Leaders—and that’s where you come in, Trainer. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_4_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been a huge help in our efforts to track down Giovanni. I’m happy to report that the team leaders and I have made significant headway in our investigation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_4_1
TEXT: I’ve managed to finish building another Super Rocket Radar for you. You can use it to find and defeat Giovanni—and save that Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_1
TEXT: The fight against Team GO Rocket and their malicious machinations continues, but at least for today we can rest knowing that we’ve foiled their latest scheme.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_2
TEXT: So, until next time—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you looked up at the sky lately? I thought I’d been staring at reports for too long, but no, there are rainbows everywhere!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_1
TEXT: That’s not all—I’ve also heard rumors that a mysterious Pokémon has been sighted wherever these rainbows appear. They say rainbows bring good luck, so why not follow one to the end? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_2
TEXT: In all seriousness, why don’t you go for a stroll and see for yourself? You never know what we might find!

TEXT: Keep your eye on the sky, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m afraid I have some dire news... It sounds like Team GO Rocket’s gotten wind of these sightings and have set out to catch the mysterious Pokémon for themselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_1
TEXT: Perhaps they're looking for a bit of good luck as well! Haha! Well, whatever their motive, we can’t have them creating more powerful Shadow Pokémon. It’s time to do some investigating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_2
TEXT: Knowing how large Team GO Rocket’s forces are, I fear they may have already found it, no doubt leaving Shadow Pokémon in their wake. Let’s go catch some Shadow Pokémon and see where they lead us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_0
TEXT: Great job rescuing all those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! I wish we had time to celebrate, but I just discovered that Team GO Rocket caught up to our mysterious Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_1
TEXT: ...and that it’s none other than Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pokémon! But don’t be discouraged! I truly believe that with enough determination, we can save it, just as we have in the past.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_2
TEXT: Let’s prep for the gauntlet of battles ahead and gather more information about Ho-Oh’s whereabouts by pursuing more Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_0
TEXT: Great job saving even more Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! Through your efforts, we’ve learned that Ho-Oh has been handed off to Giovanni and made into a Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_1
TEXT: For now, I want you to find and defeat Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra! Doing so will help us build a Super Rocket Radar that’ll lead us right to Giovanni...and to Ho-Oh! Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! With a Super Rocket Radar in hand, we’ll have no problem finding Giovanni. Defeating him in battle, however, is another story entirely...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_1
TEXT: Still! Seeing how you were able to beat his underlings, I’m certain you’ll come out on top—and save Ho-Oh to boot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_0
TEXT: What a magnificent battle, %PLAYERNAME%! Congrats on defeating Giovanni and saving Ho-Oh from his clutches.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket never rests, so we should continue to be vigilant. In the meantime, why not get to know your newly saved Ho-Oh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_2
TEXT: With the right care and a little luck, any Shadow Pokémon can be purified! I wish you the best, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll see you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_0
TEXT: Ahhh... Do you smell that, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_1
TEXT: I first caught a whiff of that curious aroma as I was out on my daily morning walk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_2
TEXT: Upon investigation, I discovered that the scent was being produced by an uncommonly large group of Roselia that had assembled nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_3
TEXT: Did you know you can judge a Roselia’s health by the strength of its aroma? Well, let me tell you—those were VERY healthy Roselia!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_4
TEXT: But while they certainly smell nice and look pretty, I advise you to take care when encountering them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_5
TEXT: The thorns on Roselia’s head contain a vicious poison, and it can launch them at any opponent bold enough to try to steal the flowers on its arms. Every rose, as they say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_6
TEXT: It’s unusual to see so many Roselia in one place. Would you mind assisting me in researching this phenomenon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I did some reading on Roselia.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_2
TEXT: When it comes to Pokémon, new discoveries are being made all the time—so it’s important to make sure your information is up to date.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_3
TEXT: Roselia, the Thorn Pokémon, evolves from Budew, the Bud Pokémon. Budew is sensitive to changes in temperature, and its bud is said to bloom when warmed by the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_4
TEXT: It’s also both Grass and Poison type, much like Roselia.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_5
TEXT: In reviewing these two Pokémon, I remembered something tremendously exciting! I still need to conduct a bit more research before sharing my findings, however. Would you mind assisting me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_0
TEXT: As aromatic Pokémon go, we’re pretty fortunate it’s Roselia appearing en masse and not, say, Muk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_1
TEXT: A big group of Muk gathered under the sun... The whole place would smell like baked garbage!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_2
TEXT: Oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Didn’t realize you were back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_3
TEXT: I found that interesting bit of information I wanted to share with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_4
TEXT: According to my research, Roselia that drink nutritionally rich springwater are said to reveal rare coloration when they bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t that fascinating? Have you seen anything like that while you’ve been out doing research?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_6
TEXT: You seem to have a lucky streak, so I wouldn’t put it past you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_7
TEXT: Now that you’re back, I’d like you to evolve a Roselia with the Sinnoh Stone I gave you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_8
TEXT: I’m excited to see the final Evolution in this line of Grass- and Poison-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! Your Roselia has evolved into the Bouquet Pokémon, Roserade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_1
TEXT: It moves like a dancer and strikes with whips that are densely lined with poison thorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_2
TEXT: Oh, and have you noticed that each of Roserade’s hands is a different color?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_3
TEXT: Each contains a different toxin. The poison in its right hand is quick acting, while the poison in its left hand is slow acting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_4
TEXT: What an amazing Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your assistance today, Trainer. Documenting situations like this is essential to learning more about the Pokémon in the world around us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_6
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_1
TEXT: As you know, I’ve recently been conducting research on several different regions in the world of Pokémon. Along the way, I came across some books that collected stories and legends from various regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_2
TEXT: One of these tomes told of three Legendary Pokémon from the Unova region—a trio that seem to be capable of changing formes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_3
TEXT: Needless to say, that piqued my interest, and I became so enveloped in my research that I even began seeing those three Legendary Pokémon in my dreams!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_4
TEXT: Which brings me to why I called you here. Can you help me with some research, Trainer? I was thinking we could start by catching some Rock-type Pokémon—you know, just to give ourselves a sturdy foundation to build from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_5
TEXT: ...Get it? Sturdy? Because they’re...Rock-type? A-anyway, I’d appreciate the help. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. Now that we’ve established a foundation for our research, we need to narrow our focus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_1
TEXT: There are three stories I want to investigate, so I think the best approach is to focus on one story at a time and see what we can learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_2
TEXT: My hope is to discover as much as we can about these Pokémon, so that when we see clues or signs of their appearance, we’re as prepared as possible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_3
TEXT: This first story tells of a Legendary Pokémon called Landorus. The story says that lands visited by Landorus yield such bountiful crops that it’s been hailed as “The Guardian of the Fields.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_4
TEXT: Landorus seems to have two formes: Incarnate Forme, and the very rarely seen Therian Forme. I haven’t been able to find any imagery depicting the latter, but every source I’ve read agrees on its existence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_5
TEXT: For now, why don’t we research Ground-type Pokémon? Maybe in doing so we can better equip ourselves to identify Landorus’s Therian Forme when the time comes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we’ve gained a better understanding of Landorus after studying Ground-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_1
TEXT: And is that a Drilbur you’ve got there? I dig it! ...Haha! Sorry, sorry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_2
TEXT: Anyway, since we’ve explored all our leads on Landorus for the moment, what do you say we move on to another Pokémon from my dream?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_3
TEXT: Let’s focus on Tornadus next. The texts say Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms, and that its power is great enough to blow houses away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_4
TEXT: Like Landorus, Tornadus also has both Incarnate and Therian Formes. Hmm... Maybe researching Flying-type Pokémon in the area is our best bet for now? Let’s give it a shot, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer! Thanks for documenting that information about Tornadus. It seems you even found yourself a darling Ducklett along the way! Is it all it’s quacked up to be? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_1
TEXT: I think we’ve learned everything we can about Tornadus for now. Its Therian Forme is still a mystery, but hopefully not for long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_2
TEXT: Before we start investigating the final Legendary Pokémon from my dream, I need to share something...strange.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_3
TEXT: You see, I’d been running myself a bit ragged with research, so I stopped for an afternoon nap. In the resulting dream, I saw those three Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, clear as crystal. But then, the whole dream just started...fading.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_4
TEXT: It was almost like something was eating the dream itself. I’m still not sure what to make of it all, but let's stay on the lookout for anything suspicious. I have a hunch this may be the work of a Pokémon nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_5
TEXT: For now, though, let’s continue our research and turn our attention to the last of the three Unovan Legendary Pokémon detailed in those stories—Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_6
TEXT: Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pokémon, and its story also references both Incarnate and Therian Formes. The spikes on its tail are said to discharge immense bolts of lightning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_7
TEXT: For the sake of consistency, let’s go ahead and research Electric-type Pokémon in the area as we compile our notes on Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_0
TEXT: Ah, there you are, %PLAYERNAME%. I have something big to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_1
TEXT: But first, I want to thank you for all your hard work collecting information on Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_2
TEXT: I feel confident that when the time comes, you’ll be prepared to encounter any of these amazing Legendary Pokémon—regardless of which forme they appear in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_3
TEXT: Now—do you remember that strange experience I had where my dream began fading inexplicably? I think I may have finally uncovered the cause.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_4
TEXT: While consulting the Pokédex for possible culprits, I came across an entry for a Pokémon called Munna. It’s known as the Dream Eater Pokémon—so you can see why it caught my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_5
TEXT: Munna is said to eat the dreams of both people and Pokémon, expelling mist as a result. The mist is pink if the dream is pleasant, and black if it’s a nightmare.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_6
TEXT: I was pretty pleased to be dreaming of those Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, so I suspect Munna’s mist was nice and rosy that day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_7
TEXT: Munna seems like a fascinating Pokémon, and I can’t wait to research it more. I hope you’ll give me a hand when the time comes, Trainer! Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_1
TEXT: I just got back from a lengthy stroll in the sunshine. It’s incredible how much a bit of fresh air can affect your energy and mood!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_2
TEXT: But that’s not the only thing that’s got me feeling chipper. You see, I witnessed something quite interesting while I was out and about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps in response to the abundant sunlight, a congregation of Snivy appears to have formed nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_4
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but this seems to me like a golden opportunity to research the Grass Snake Pokémon. Could you lend me a hand?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_5
TEXT: They’re known to be fairly calm, so you shouldn’t have much trouble observing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_6
TEXT: Good luck out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Great work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_1
TEXT: I have some information for you on why Snivy are so fond of the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_2
TEXT: These Grass-type Pokémon photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight. Much like the sunshine they crave, Snivy are quite bright!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_3
TEXT: They were first encountered in the Unova region, where they were known for their intelligence and calm demeanor. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_4
TEXT: While we continue researching their sudden appearance, could you evolve a Snivy for me? I’d like to document its Evolution, Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_5
TEXT: Take care when you do, however—Servine is known for its masterful whipping techniques.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s a mighty fine Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_1
TEXT: Like Snivy, Servine is known as the Grass Snake Pokémon. It moves along the ground as if sliding. Though it’s far from sluggish, it won’t hesitate to seek out the shadows of thick foliage to avoid attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve properly documented Snivy and Servine, I’d like to move on to Serperior, Snivy’s final Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_3
TEXT: Serperior is known as the Regal Pokémon, and much like Snivy and Servine, it also has a penchant for sunlight. It takes in solar energy and boosts it internally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_4
TEXT: Could you evolve your Servine into Serperior for me, Trainer? It’ll be a great boon to my research, and you’ll have a powerful Grass-type Pokémon to join your journey as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer! I have no doubt Serperior will prove a potent asset on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_1
TEXT: It has an incredible ability to stop its opponents’ movements with a single glare. Should the opponent prove bold enough to continue, Serperior will give its all in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_2
TEXT: Having a Pokémon like that by your side would be pretty inspiring, I’d say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, thanks again for all your help in this sun-soaked endeavor. I think I’ll take one more walk before the day’s done—can’t let weather like this go to waste!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_4
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve dropped by just in time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_1
TEXT: As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_2
TEXT: Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_3
TEXT: When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_4
TEXT: I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pokémon, and I think there’s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pokémon that is bound to a strange stone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_1
TEXT: I can’t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pokémon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pokémon, it will appear?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_2
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we’ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_1
TEXT: I can’t tell if it’s the weather, but I’ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_2
TEXT: I'll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_1
TEXT: It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2
TEXT: It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3
TEXT: Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1
TEXT: Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2
TEXT: Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0
TEXT: On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1
TEXT: Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2
TEXT: I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3
TEXT: Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0
TEXT: So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1
TEXT: Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2
TEXT: I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3
TEXT: Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_1
TEXT: I’d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I’ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping—yes, like birds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_4
TEXT: Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_1
TEXT: Ah—Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pokémon. Hmm... It’s all beginning to make sense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_2
TEXT: Swablu’s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_3
TEXT: At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_4
TEXT: Swablu apparently love to sit on people’s heads. They look like fluffy hats!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_5
TEXT: Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_6
TEXT: Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_7
TEXT: A fascinating Pokémon through and through, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_8
TEXT: Evolving Swablu takes some effort, but I assure you—it’s well worth it! I’m sure a Trainer of your talent could gather the necessary Candy in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_9
TEXT: I’d love to see its Evolution in person, so could you evolve your Swablu for me? Be sure to use Pinap Berries to earn even more Candy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve been hard at work catching Swablu.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_1
TEXT: Evolving Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_2
TEXT: Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it really is an integral part of being a great Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_3
TEXT: As the saying goes: good things come to those who wait!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_4
TEXT: All your hard work will feel justified once you witness your darling Swablu evolve. Of that, you have my word!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_5
TEXT: Just one more leg of this journey left to go, %PLAYERNAME%. Let's go!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I see your efforts have paid off. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_1
TEXT: Swablu’s Evolution, Altaria, is called the Humming Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_2
TEXT: It’s known to wrap its wings around the people it’s bonded with—much like yours is doing with you now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_3
TEXT: And humming all the while! You know, people say that Altaria’s humming could enrapture an entire audience with its beauty, and it’s not hard to see why.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_4
TEXT: Between Altaria’s song and your remarkable bond, I have to say I’m feeling quite moved!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_5
TEXT: You truly are an incredible Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks for your help on this latest adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll never get tired of learning more about Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_7
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_0
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2
TEXT: let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3
TEXT: I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5
TEXT: I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6
TEXT: It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7
TEXT: Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8
TEXT: Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1
TEXT: These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2
TEXT: This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0
TEXT: I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2
TEXT: I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3
TEXT: I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0
TEXT: Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1
TEXT: That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_0
TEXT: You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_2
TEXT: By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_3
TEXT: I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1
TEXT: I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_2
TEXT: The four of us have powerful bonds with our buddies. Blanche has formed a wonderful relationship with Lapras, Candela has had Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, and Spark has developed an electrifying bond with Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_3
TEXT: My buddy is the Mythical Pokémon Meltan. Since Meltan and I met, I’ve been documenting everything I learn about it. And trust me—there’s a lot to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_4
TEXT: I’ve actually heard some reports of Meltan sightings recently. Maybe you’ll run into one on your adventures?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_5
TEXT: Definitely something to keep an eye out for as we begin our research. But first, let’s stock up on some supplies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Seems like you’re all set to head out on this research adventure. Why don’t we start by looking at the cool pair that is Blanche and Lapras?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_1
TEXT: Known as the Transport Pokémon, Lapras is both Water- and Ice-type. A smart and kindhearted Pokémon, it glides across the surface of the sea while its beautiful song echoes around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_2
TEXT: Lapras are known to have gentle hearts and can even understand human speech. I completely understand why Blanche chose Lapras as a buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_3
TEXT: That said, Blanche clearly feels a special connection to Lapras.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_4
TEXT: Blanche got Lapras by trading with a fellow Team Mystic Trainer. I wonder if that has something to do with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_5
TEXT: At any rate, let’s focus our research on Water- and Ice-type Pokémon to learn more about the Pokémon that Blanche holds dear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_1
TEXT: Be sure to tell your Lapras I said hi! I never miss a chance to greet new Pokémon. Now, let’s move on to our next dynamic duo: Spark and Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_2
TEXT: The leader of Team Instinct has always had a soft spot for Pokémon that hatch from Eggs, so it’s only natural that he’d have a buddy like Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_3
TEXT: But don’t let this Pokémon’s small stature fool you! Spark’s Elekid is incredibly powerful, making it a fitting buddy for the energetic team leader.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_4
TEXT: Why hasn’t Spark evolved his Elekid? Well, Evolution should be approached with care.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_5
TEXT: I’m sure Spark will know when Elekid is ready to evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_6
TEXT: Spark may seem pretty carefree, but few are more committed to the care and training of Pokémon than him.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_7
TEXT: What do you say we research some Electric-type Pokémon that Spark tends to work with?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_0
TEXT: How did your research go, Trainer? I think it’s time to turn our attention to some Fire-type Pokémon—specifically the Fire Horse Pokémon Rapidash.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_1
TEXT: This Pokémon has a competitive streak, making it a great match for Candela, the leader of Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_2
TEXT: Candela has had her Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, so you can be sure the two of them have been on more than a few adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_3
TEXT: Rapidash loves to run and gallop, so Candela always makes sure her Buddy Pokémon has plenty of time and space to do just that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_4
TEXT: That kind of care is critical for building strong, lasting relationships with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_5
TEXT: Candela’s passion and dedication make her a great role model for her fellow Team Valor members—and everyone, really.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_6
TEXT: Maybe researching Fire-type Pokémon will help you learn more about Candela’s fiery spirit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for conducting that research on Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve learned more about the Pokémon that Blanche, Spark, and Candela call their buddies, it’s time to do some research on my Buddy Pokémon: Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_2
TEXT: I remember when I first met my Meltan. I was out doing some research when I stumbled upon a group of them. I’d never seen a Pokémon like it before, and I wanted to share my findings with my mentor, Professor Oak.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_3
TEXT: The group of Meltan eventually departed, but one Meltan stuck around, and we’ve been together ever since!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_4
TEXT: At first, I assumed Meltan only stayed to snack on all the metal knickknacks in my mobile lab. But as time passed, our bond grew stronger, and now we’re practically inseparable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_5
TEXT: Our favorite thing is to go on long walks and look for metallic snacks for Meltan. Which reminds me—we still need to look into those reports of Meltan appearing nearby!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_6
TEXT: Let’s do some investigating and see if we can find any Meltan, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_0
TEXT: Well done, Trainer! Thanks to your hard work, you have your very own Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_1
TEXT: I’m sure that if you take the time to build up your relationship, Meltan will evolve into Melmetal in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_2
TEXT: Melmetal stands over eight feet tall. By using centrifugal force, Melmetal can use its heavy hex-nut arms to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_3
TEXT: But I’m getting ahead of myself. Now is the time to focus on the friendship between you and your Buddy Pokémon—whether it be Meltan or any other Pokémon that you feel a special bond with.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_4
TEXT: After studying the bonds the team leaders and I have with our Buddy Pokémon, I hope you feel inspired to find a buddy you can grow with as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_5
TEXT: I’ve no doubt you and your Buddy Pokémon will achieve some incredible things—and Meltan and I will be cheering you on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_6
TEXT: Thank again for your assistance. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. Do you have anything fun planned for today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_1
TEXT: I’ll be attending a picnic with the team leaders, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_2
TEXT: I must say, though, I was having a pretty hard time deciding what I should bring. Candela’s in charge of sandwiches, Spark is handling refreshments, and Blanche is bringing shaved ice, so the bases are all pretty well covered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_3
TEXT: Walking always clears my head, so I took a stroll and ended up spotting a large group of Tepig near where I normally pick my go-to snack, Pinap Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_4
TEXT: And suddenly—inspiration! Did you know Tepig loves to eat roasted Berries, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_5
TEXT: The Fire Pig Pokémon blows fire balls through its nose and roasts the berries before it eats them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_6
TEXT: Roasted Berries sound like a great picnic snack, don’t you think? And speaking of, I need to start getting them ready. Why don’t you go check out the Tepig in the meantime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_1
TEXT: Ah, I see you’ve caught a Tepig of your own! They make terrific companions in all aspects of life.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_2
TEXT: Tepig evolves into Pignite, which, like Tepig, is known as the Fire Pig Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_3
TEXT: When Pignite’s internal fire flares up, its movements grow sharper and faster. Whatever it eats becomes fuel for the flame in its stomach. Must do wonders for digestion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_4
TEXT: Oh! That reminds me—I need to check on my roasted Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_5
TEXT: While I finish up my picnic preparations, why don’t you see about evolving your Tepig into Pignite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%. The Berry-roasting process is going swimmingly, and the whole place smells delicious!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_1
TEXT: Just when I thought Pokémon couldn’t inspire me any more than they already do, here I am taking cooking tips from Tepig. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_2
TEXT: Nice Pignite, by the way! Very round. Did you know that Pignite can evolve? Its Evolution is a Pokémon called Emboar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_3
TEXT: Emboar is known to heat up its punches by setting its fists ablaze with its fiery chin. It’s also known to care deeply about its friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_4
TEXT: Speaking of friends, I should let the team leaders know that I’ll be on my way soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_5
TEXT: How about evolving your Pignite into Emboar, Trainer? I’d love to see its fiery beard firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Emboar is truly a sight to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_1
TEXT: This powerful Fire- and Fighting-type Pokémon is known as the Mega Fire Pig Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_2
TEXT: According to my research, Emboar is a master of fast and powerful Fighting-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_3
TEXT: And wow... Look at that beard of fire. What do you think, Trainer? Could you see me with one of those?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_4
TEXT: Haha, only joking! I’m sure I’d find it far too itchy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I should let you get back to exploring. And I should get to that picnic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_6
TEXT: Have a wonderful weekend, and keep up all the hard work. It’s always a joy to see how much you’ve grown as a Trainer each time we meet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_7
TEXT: I’ll be in touch soon with some more research opportunities. Or who knows—maybe even some recipes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_8
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1
TEXT: Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2
TEXT: ...Uh, moving along...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3
TEXT: Weedle’s horn measures about two inches. It’s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate Weedle further—but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to get poked by one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0
TEXT: Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research—Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1
TEXT: It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and—in my opinion—honkable nose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2
TEXT: I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don’t think to offer me any.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s Evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0
TEXT: Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1
TEXT: Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2
TEXT: And that’s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn’t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we’ve learned so much about what’s happening to Kakuna!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it’s been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0
TEXT: Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1
TEXT: Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2
TEXT: This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pokémon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn’t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab’s tires!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_1
TEXT: I came to study Pokémon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pokémon I’ve observed today don’t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_2
TEXT: Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pokémon around, it almost feels like a safari!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_3
TEXT: Please complete the following research tasks:

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_1_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_1_1
TEXT: I can tell this Dratini has the potential to become a close friend of yours! Why don’t you two take some time to get to know each other?

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_3_2
TEXT: You should take a look and see if you can find anything new.

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_0
TEXT: Amazing! You found some rare Pokémon that were first discovered in the Sinnoh region already? And is that...a Shiny Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_1
TEXT: Amazing! I’ve never seen an Eevee like that before! Shiny Pokémon have a rare and distinct coloration that sets them apart from others of their species!

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_5_0
