RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. As you know, I do a lot of research. There are just so many Pokémon to learn about and document!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Recently, I’ve been investigating Ralts, the Feeling Pokémon, to learn more about how this Pokémon senses people’s emotions by using the horns on its head.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: It’s an amazing ability, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I thought studying this Pokémon’s unique sensing powers could help me identify the strange feeling that’s been stirring inside me these past few weeks.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I’ve realized, though, that this isn’t any ordinary emotion—it’s a type of energy!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: This mysterious energy is filling me with hope and determination. I feel like I could take on any challenge and be victorious!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_6
TEXT: I would appreciate your assistance in collecting more information on this strange and fascinating phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing the research we needed to get started, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: While you were catching Pokémon and visiting PokéStops, I started digging through my research and found references to a phenomenon that seems to have a lot in common with what I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: The reports refer to a Mythical Pokémon that shares the infinite energy it creates with others to guarantee victory.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: The reports also state that this Pokémon is Psychic- and Fire-type. What an amazing combination!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: To get closer to confirming the source of the energy, let’s focus our efforts on catching Pokémon that share those same types.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts researching Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, we’re well on our way to confirming the source of this mysterious energy.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: There’s many a mystery surrounding our path forward, so I’ll keep poring over our research notes. In the meantime, I’d like you to work on becoming better friends with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: As a Trainer, strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon is an important task that requires a specific set of skills.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: To further develop those skills, why don’t you try spending time with your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Successful partnerships take work and dedication, and talented Trainers build lifelong friendships with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: That being said, be sure to spend time with your buddy every day!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: You have a wonderful bond with your buddy, Trainer! It’s been a treat watching that friendship bloom. Now, though, it’s time to focus our efforts on the matter at hand!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: After further examination of the research you completed, I’m convinced that the Pokémon we’re looking for is Victini, the Victory Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only would this be consistent with the references to a Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, but it would also explain the mysterious surge of energy I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: It’s time for you to befriend Victini. Since this Pokémon represents victory, I think winning a few battles might inspire it to come forward!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: I’ve been hearing reports that Team GO Rocket is causing trouble. Battling these troublemakers just might show this Pokémon you’re worthy of attention!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Let’s see whether some victory will attract the Victory Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Absolutely astounding, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d be able to display your powerful bonds and battle prowess to impress the Mythical Pokémon Victini.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: It shares the infinite energy it creates when its body overflows with power, so I’m absolutely certain now that the energy I was feeling was coming directly from Victini!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: Be sure to use this power wisely, %PLAYERNAME%, as you and Victini take on new challenges. But for now, your hard work calls for a celebration!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: Why don’t you take a few snapshots with Victini and share your success with fellow Trainers by sending them some Gifts?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_0
TEXT: Once again, you have helped me uncover a huge discovery. I cannot thank you enough for your time and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is filled with endless discoveries, and it isn’t every day we come across a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: I hope that you will take the lessons we learned together through this investigation and apply them to your training.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: I’m proud of you, %PLAYERNAME%, and hope you continue to strive to be your very best. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_1

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_10

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_11
TEXT: Now, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m sure you know what I’m going to say next.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_12
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: I thought it would be fun to give you some tasks to help you research this phenomenon. I’ll make sure you get a reward for your hard work!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: Don’t delay—since different Pokémon seem to be appearing each hour, you have limited time to complete these tasks! You can see Trainers’ progress by checking the Global Challenge Arena.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: To help with your research, be sure to use Incense to attract Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_5
TEXT: Remember, you can now activate several Incense at once and have them attract Pokémon to you for hours! Incense smells amazing, doesn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_6

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_7

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket confetti is raining down from the sky. Grunts are invading PokéStops all around the world. And...Team GO Rocket has taken over Pokémon GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: We thought we put a stop to them when we ended their take-over during our research leading up to GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: But that take-over appears to have been only part of a larger plan. We have yet to determine Team GO Rocket’s ultimate goal, though. Regardless of what it is, %PLAYERNAME%...you must prepare yourself.

TEXT: I’m impressed by your energy and that of your fellow Trainers around the world! If we work together, I know victory is within our reach!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Pokémon are ready for battle, and I bet your fellow Trainers are thankful for the supplies you’ve sent their way. We’ll need to work together to keep Team GO Rocket at bay and save Pokémon GO Fest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Oh, what’s this? Looks like the snapshots you took feature some unwelcome guests! It’s amazing that Team GO Rocket can organize these massive take-overs, but its members do seem a little silly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe these photobombs are actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don’t you put all your training to use? In the meantime, I’ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, you’ve caught a Golem!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been scoping out the Team GO Rocket balloons and have discovered that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are using Flying-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Sources told me that Team GO Rocket might’ve captured some Legendary Pokémon and turned them into Shadow Pokémon, too!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: If I recall correctly, the team leaders saw one of these balloons at GO Fest last year—and another during the Team GO Rocket take-over a few weeks ago.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t have imagined that Team GO Rocket would spend resources on such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it’s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into providing his Grunts with balloons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to rock Team GO Rocket’s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo. Now all that’s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela can handle the Team GO Rocket Leaders while you prepare to face the boss. It’s interesting that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are commanding these Legendary Shadow Pokémon, which are usually reserved for the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll learn what this means as we uncover Team GO Rocket’s devious plans and discover what Pokémon Giovanni now has under his control.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: On the bright side, I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that powerful energy I detected yesterday?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: The team leaders reported that Trainers worldwide suddenly felt a similar energy that filled them with hope and determination. Through my research, I found references to that very same energy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: They document a Mythical Pokémon that shares its infinite energy with others and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling that’s why Team GO Rocket is here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: Perhaps Team GO Rocket hopes to further its dastardly plans by using this powerful Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pokémon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type attacks. The Machamp you caught earlier might help you here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_8
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. The fate of Pokémon GO Fest is in your hands.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and sent him packing! Who would’ve thought that he could turn even Mewtwo into a Shadow Pokémon? That alone is a mystery we need to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_1

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Turns out, Team GO Rocket was after Victini, the Victory Pokémon! Some say this Pokémon brings victory to its Trainer, regardless of the contest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: I’m now sure that the energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I’m in utter awe of your tenacity and determination. Pokémon GO Fest was saved because of your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_0

Where you cannot exercise one of these rights due to such an exception, we will explain to you why.<br><br>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the Personal Data that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.<br><br>We aim to provide the information or complete the outcome you request within 30 days.<br><br>Children<br><br>As a general rule, if you are outside the EEA, children under 13 are not allowed to use the Services. If you are based in the EEA you may only use the Services if you are over 16, or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data in your country of residence. We do however allow children to use the Pokémon GO Service, provided we have the required parental consent. For more details please read the Game-Specific Disclosures at the end of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>If we learn that we have collected Personal Data of a child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data, and we do not have parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.<br><br>Changes to this Privacy Policy<br><br>Any Personal Data that we collect is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be given reasonable notice of any material change.<br><br>Third Parties<br><br>In using our Services you may access links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third Party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third Party Service or that is collected by a Third Party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third Party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy, or security practices and policies of any Third Party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Service that you access.<br><br>11. Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pokémon GO<br><br>Pokémon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pokémon GO using your third-party Pokémon Trainer Club (“PTC”) account administered by The Pokémon Company International (“TPCI”). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the “Accounts with Children” paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pokémon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (“Parent”) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (“Child”), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child’s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent’s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent’s social security number and the Parent’s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent’s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pokémon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child’s access to and use of Pokémon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child’s registration on Pokémon GO and prevent the Child’s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child’s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child’s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pokémon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child’s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data. If you use Pokémon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data about your fitness activity (Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the “Health App Data”).   We may store Health App Data on our servers in connection with your Pokémon GO user account.   We use Health App Data to provide you certain functionality in the game (such as distances walked to hatch Eggs), and to ensure you get “credit” in your Apple Health App for all of the walking you do while playing Pokémon GO.  We will not use Health App Data for marketing or advertising purposes.  We do not store Health App Data in iCloud.  Pokémon GO cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.<br>Additional Privacy Information for Ingress<br><br>Information shared publicly. When you play Ingress, as part of the gameplay the following information about you will be shared through the game (including with other players directly within the app, in game notifications emailed to other players as part of the gameplay, and online on the Ingress Intel Map website), and will therefore become publicly available: your in-game username, messages sent to other users in COMMS, and in-game portals that you interact with, as well as your device location whenever you take an in-game action.<br>

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_0
TEXT: Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. I always run into you when I find something exciting. Maybe you’re my Special Research good-luck charm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_1
TEXT: Last night, I was studying the chemical reaction that causes Trubbish to appear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_2
TEXT: Suddenly I saw bright flashing lights in the near distance and went to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_3
TEXT: When I arrived at the site, I noticed a lot of damage to the ground and the surrounding area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_4
TEXT: At first, the damage looked to be caused by Trainers practicing for the GO Battle League, but my gut told me to investigate further in the morning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_5
TEXT: While I look into this, can you help me research Normal-type Pokémon? Some of the damage looks like it was caused by a Normal-type attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_0
TEXT: Thanks for getting that baseline research taken care of for me, %PLAYERNAME%. I have some updates to share with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_1
TEXT: After I returned to the site we’re studying, I realized there was actually a trail of damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_2
TEXT: When I followed that trail, I started finding areas that were clearly burned.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_3
TEXT: That damage must have been done by a Fire-type Pokémon—or at least a Pokémon that knows Fire-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_4
TEXT: You know what this means, Trainer! Time to research Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_5
TEXT: The more information we have about this type of Pokémon, the more clues we’ll have to determine whatever did all this damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_6
TEXT: Meanwhile, I’ll continue following the trail of damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You’re on fire?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_1
TEXT: Anyway...the damage can’t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_2
TEXT: Could it really have been caused by Pokémon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pokémon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_3
TEXT: As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn’t seem to line up with any Pokémon I’ve encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’m so glad you’re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_1
TEXT: I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_2
TEXT: She shared some notes about a Mythical Pokémon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_3
TEXT: Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pokémon is Bug and Steel type, it’s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_4
TEXT: This lines up with the damage at the site we’ve been researching!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5
TEXT: One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_6
TEXT: I’ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pokémon to help us get to the bottom of this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_0
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_1
TEXT: With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we’ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon Genesect!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_2
TEXT: I know what you’re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3
TEXT: Apparently, when this Pokémon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pokémon’s holding.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_4
TEXT: I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_5
TEXT: I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pokémon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_6
TEXT: You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I’ve come across something...groundbreaking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_1
TEXT: I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_2
TEXT: At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_3
TEXT: These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pokémon in particular.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_4
TEXT: Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pokémon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_0
TEXT: Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_1
TEXT: This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pokémon. I wonder if we’ll find another Pokémon that will help us solve this puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_2
TEXT: I have one in mind, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_3
TEXT: I’m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we’ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_0
TEXT: As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_1
TEXT: I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pokémon. It’s said that it made Pokémon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_2
TEXT: Could it be these Pokémon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_3
TEXT: If the first two Pokémon were Regirock and Regice...then there’s only one left that we must research further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work. I believe we’re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_1
TEXT: We’re close to coming across the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pokémon towed continents with rope.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_2
TEXT: Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_3
TEXT: Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you’ll make a colossal discovery of your own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_0
TEXT: Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_1
TEXT: I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I’ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pokémon deep in slumber.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_2
TEXT: We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_3
TEXT: Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I’ll see if I can find anything about this Pokémon in any of my texts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure the resources you’ve earned will be crucial.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_1
TEXT: I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pokémon that grants wishes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_2
TEXT: I’m still researching the best way to awaken this Pokémon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pokémon in the area showing signs of distress.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_3
TEXT: Could I ask you to investigate these reports?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_1
TEXT: Many of the Pokémon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_2
TEXT: I’d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I’m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_3
TEXT: As you return the Pokémon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pokémon in their habitats?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_1
TEXT: Apparently there’s an unusual phenomenon where Pokémon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I’ve heard Spark refer to it as a “photobomb.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_2
TEXT: I’m eternally amused—and amazed—by the things we learn about Pokémon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_3
TEXT: These Pokémon all seem to have something in common—music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_4
TEXT: What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_0
TEXT: That’s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pokémon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_1
TEXT: The ancient text was right—this Mythical Pokémon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be—I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_3
TEXT: It isn’t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pokémon in such diverse habitats—not to mention meeting a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_4
TEXT: I’m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I’ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_0
TEXT: Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m excited to get started on our next big adventure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_1
TEXT: What do we need to do? Well, I’ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_2
TEXT: We’re going to focus our efforts on Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pokémon I’ve never seen before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_3
TEXT: First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_4
TEXT: Can you explore the area? Who knows—you might make some friends along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_0
TEXT: Great job, Trainer. Your work helped me get a better understanding of the search area for this mysterious Pokémon. I can’t wait to show you what I’ve been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_1
TEXT: A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_2
TEXT: It mentions a Mythical Pokémon that awakens once every thousand years and has the ability to grant wishes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_3
TEXT: I really want to get a deeper understanding of this text, and how better to do that than with some research? Can you help me collect some information on Pokémon from the Hoenn region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Hoenn Pokédex is really looking great!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_1
TEXT: The Whismur you caught reminded me of a line from the text I told you about. It mentioned that a melody or a sound can awaken a sleeping Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_2
TEXT: That gives me an idea... Let’s do a little experiment. There’s a sleeping Snorlax that hasn’t left my lab in months. And it’s right in front of my Berry stash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_3
TEXT: Think we could wake it up with a loud noise? Let’s document the Whismur Evolution line, too—some photos will do.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_0
TEXT: Wow! That sure was loud, but it did the trick! Loudred worked just like an alarm clock for poor Snorlax.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_1
TEXT: I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we’ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_2
TEXT: If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pokémon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_3
TEXT: The text says that the Pokémon is a Steel and Psychic type, so I think a good next step is to catch a few Pokémon with similar characteristics.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_4
TEXT: We’ll need a few extra hands to get this done, too. Could you get some fellow Trainers to help out?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I’ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_1
TEXT: It says that when the Mythical Pokémon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_2
TEXT: Another interesting tidbit: If this Pokémon senses danger, it will fight without awakening. Up for a Trainer Battle, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_3
TEXT: If the battle causes any reactions nearby, I have sensors set up to detect them. It might seem like a long shot, but I have a good feeling about this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_0
TEXT: It worked! I’m picking up some vibrations nearby. I think we’re on the right track.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_1
TEXT: Maybe the Mythical Pokémon is close to awakening. Since what we’re doing is working, let’s keep it up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_2
TEXT: We need to pull out all the stops, though, and the timing has to be just right.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_3
TEXT: I’ll hold things down here with Loudred while you keep focusing on encountering Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_4
TEXT: If you can do that, I think it’ll help the Mythical Pokémon see that you’re a worthy Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_0
TEXT: Simply astonishing! We encountered the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_1
TEXT: That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Well, once in several lifetimes, if Jirachi truly only wakes once every thousand years.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_2
TEXT: You’ve become such an accomplished Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%. Thank you for going on this amazing adventure with me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_3
TEXT: You can bet I’ll be in touch whenever another exciting research project comes up. Until then, let’s get out there and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_0
TEXT: How was 2019 for you, %PLAYERNAME%? For me, it was a fantastic year, and I want to thank you and all our Trainers around the world for your hard work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_1
TEXT: Together, we took on Team GO Rocket, uncovered the Wish Pokémon, Jirachi, and began encountering Pokémon originally discovered in Unova.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_2
TEXT: I want to make sure you know how proud I am of how much you and all the other Trainers have grown this last year!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_3
TEXT: And now with 2020 on the horizon, there are sure to be many more adventures awaiting! Until then, let’s get up and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_1
TEXT: Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra’s ability to teleport.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_2
TEXT: When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it’s made copies of itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_3
TEXT: However, what’s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let’s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_1
TEXT: It’s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_0
TEXT: I’m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I’m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_1
TEXT: While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it’s sleeping! What amazing abilities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_2
TEXT: Why don’t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I’ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I’ve developed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_3
TEXT: While it won’t give you Abra’s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.

TEXT: Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_1
TEXT: Also, from what I’ve gathered, it seems fond of forests and lush greens. Would you mind exploring this further, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_0
TEXT: Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that this Pokémon’s unstable genetic makeup enables it to take on one of several different Evolutions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_2
TEXT: I’ll bet if you spend some time with it during the day, you’ll be able to evolve your Eevee into an Espeon—a Psychic-type Pokémon just like the Mythical Pokémon I’m researching!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_3
TEXT: Can you {0}, {1}, and {2}?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_0
TEXT: Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_1
TEXT: Wait... Have we...had this conversation already? I’m getting a funny feeling in the back of my mind—like we’ve been here before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_2
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, would you spend some time with this Eevee during the night? I think you’ll be able to see an intriguing evolved form as a result.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_3
TEXT: I wonder if this funny feeling will recur...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I have some exciting news! That funny feeling hasn’t returned, but I did some important reading and learned that the Mythical Pokémon we’re researching has the ability to travel across time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_1
TEXT: Maybe that’s why all of this is occurring...or recurring... Maybe this Pokémon is nearby?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_2
TEXT: I suggest that you collect samples over the course of the next week and experiment with some Evolution items to see whether that feeling occurs again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_3
TEXT: While you’re at it, do you have any Pinap Berries? My research could benefit from more data on their use. Return with that, and you can have these exotic Silver Pinap Berries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_0
TEXT: This data is so helpful. Thank you! I’ll use it to explore my theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_1
TEXT: While you were in the field, I made more headway in learning about this Mythical Pokémon, and it seems that its mere presence causes grass and trees to flourish.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_2
TEXT: I think if you catch more Grass-type Pokémon, this elusive time-traveling Pokémon will reveal itself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_3
TEXT: Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, what an amazing experience! The appearance of the Mythical Pokémon Celebi is thought to be a sign that a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_1
TEXT: You’ve come a long way in your research, and I must say you’re inspiring me to discover even more Pokémon. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you and your fellow Trainers have been taking care of yourselves. Remember to take a break every now and then to do something you really enjoy! I like to go on short walks, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_1
TEXT: In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pokémon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_2
TEXT: Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_3
TEXT: Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn’t the first time I’ve witnessed such a gathering...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_4
TEXT: Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_2
TEXT: For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pokémon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_3
TEXT: Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_4
TEXT: Charmander’s evolved form is Charmeleon—but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_0
TEXT: That’s a fine Charmeleon you’ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_1
TEXT: Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_2
TEXT: When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_3
TEXT: The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_4
TEXT: Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pokémon! Come back and see me once you’ve evolved your Charmeleon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pokémon Charizard!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_1
TEXT: Charizard is a truly amazing Pokémon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_2
TEXT: While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_3
TEXT: What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_4
TEXT: They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_0
TEXT: I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_1
TEXT: Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_2
TEXT: Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_3
TEXT: It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_4
TEXT: Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_5
TEXT: Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_6
TEXT: Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_1
TEXT: I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pokémon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_2
TEXT: We need to figure out what’s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_1
TEXT: I’m not sure what could have caused it—they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_2
TEXT: Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_3
TEXT: The local Pokémon have become confused… It looks like they’re acting more aggressive and territorial!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_4
TEXT: Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pokémon to make the situation a bit more stable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_5
TEXT: Please catch some Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_0

TEXT: However, I'm not sure that was sufficient—the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pokémon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_2
TEXT: I've been seeing some unusual Pokémon called Unown floating around the area...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_3
TEXT: This Pokémon is shaped like ancient writing…and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pokémon—the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_4
TEXT: Let's do the following research tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_0
TEXT: Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_1
TEXT: I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_2
TEXT: Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_3
TEXT: It's a difficult task… We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_4
TEXT: The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_5
TEXT: These Pokémon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_6
TEXT: If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_7
TEXT: Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_8
TEXT: Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!
{0}
{1}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_0
TEXT: That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_1
TEXT: It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_2
TEXT: I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_3
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_4
TEXT: This weekend will be one to remember!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. Something odd is happening, and I need your help investigating it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_1
TEXT: While I was on a walk last night with my Buddy Pokémon, Meltan, I noticed a strange light flickering in my mobile lab. It was so spooky! One might’ve called it...a ghastly sight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_2
TEXT: Apparently, some Gastly were in my mobile lab hiding from the wind. It’s common for them to take shelter when massive gusts are blowing about so their gaseous bodies aren’t blown away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_3
TEXT: However, the sheer number of Gastly seemed unusual. They’re still in the mobile lab, so could you help me look into this situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were helping with our research, I was assisting the Gastly in the mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_1
TEXT: I had to be careful when I got near the Gastly. I didn’t want to be engulfed by their gaseous bodies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_2
TEXT: Now that the Gastly are out of the mobile lab, I think it’s time for us to start looking into Gastly’s Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_3
TEXT: I’ve done some reading on the matter, and I think we’ll need to prepare for a dangerous Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Seems as though your Gastly has evolved into Haunter. I had a feeling I was being watched.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_1
TEXT: It’s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it’s just being playful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_2
TEXT: I’ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don’t think Blanche is amused.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s go ahead and fix that problem by evolving Haunter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer. Your Haunter has now become the Shadow Pokémon, Gengar! Are you ready for a spooky story? Let me get my flashlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_1
TEXT: If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_2
TEXT: Do you feel that chill in the air? That means a Gengar is near. OOOoooOOOooo...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_3
TEXT: BOO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_4
TEXT: Hahaha, got you, %PLAYERNAME%! I crack myself up. Although...it looked for a second like there was a ghostly hand on your shoulder... Maybe it was just my imagination.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pokémon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it’s a fantastic Pokémon to have on your team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks to your help, I think we all learned something today! I’ll be in touch when I have another adventure for you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0
TEXT: BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1
TEXT: Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2
TEXT: Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3
TEXT: Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4
TEXT: Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5
TEXT: Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6
TEXT: Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0
TEXT: Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1
TEXT: What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2
TEXT: Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3
TEXT: After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4
TEXT: The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5
TEXT: Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0
TEXT: Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2
TEXT: I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3
TEXT: There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4
TEXT: One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6
TEXT: I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0
TEXT: Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_1
TEXT: Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2
TEXT: Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3
TEXT: All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4
TEXT: Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5
TEXT: I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Do you hear that sound?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_1
TEXT: All morning, I’ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it’s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_2
TEXT: Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_3
TEXT: Guess it’s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_4
TEXT: Anyway, I think it’ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they’re harmless.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_5
TEXT: However, I see potential in this Pokémon. It’s time to head out and investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that’s something I’d like to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_2
TEXT: Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pokémon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_3
TEXT: I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don’t you think? Let’s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_4
TEXT: Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they’re quite useful as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_0
TEXT: Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you’ve completed, it’s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_1
TEXT: Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn’t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_3
TEXT: So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type—something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_4
TEXT: Looks like you’ll be adding a powerful Pokémon to your team, but let’s proceed with caution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you’ve got yourself a Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_1
TEXT: I’m sure this Pokémon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_2
TEXT: Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_3
TEXT: I’m excited to see what kinds of challenges you’ll demolish together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_4
TEXT: Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles—not entire cities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1
TEXT: Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2
TEXT: After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_3
TEXT: It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4
TEXT: I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5
TEXT: After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6
TEXT: It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7
TEXT: Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1
TEXT: Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2
TEXT: My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3
TEXT: It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4
TEXT: It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5
TEXT: Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6
TEXT: Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0
TEXT: Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1
TEXT: I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2
TEXT: While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3
TEXT: Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4
TEXT: Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6
TEXT: I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0
TEXT: I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1
TEXT: I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2
TEXT: I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4
TEXT: I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5
TEXT: In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_6
TEXT: However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_7
TEXT: You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_8
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s always great to see you! I’m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_1
TEXT: That’s why I’ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I’ll be asking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_2
TEXT: I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pokémon that has really sent me and other Pokémon researchers into quite a tizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_3
TEXT: Can you believe an undiscovered Pokémon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_4
TEXT: I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don’t worry, though... I’m sure the repairs won’t cost me too much at the shop...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_5
TEXT: Although each Pokémon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn’t put a damper on my day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_6
TEXT: So many Ditto taking on this unique Pokémon form must mean that the real Pokémon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_7
TEXT: Let’s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don’t have much to go on, but I’m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_8
TEXT: But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you’ll gather in the field.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_1
TEXT: While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pokémon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn’t have much luck.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_2
TEXT: But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pokémon has been unseen until just recently, I think it’s safe to say that we’re tracking another Mythical Pokémon, like Mew and Celebi.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_3
TEXT: If I’m right and this elusive Pokémon is a Mythical Pokémon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_4
TEXT: But let’s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_5
TEXT: Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I’m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_6
TEXT: Please complete the following tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pokémon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it—don’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_1
TEXT: Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_2
TEXT: What luck! Did you know that when Professor Oak was my instructor, he was my role model? And he still is!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_3
TEXT: He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pokémon, so I really think we’re on to something!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_4
TEXT: Still, a name alone isn’t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don’t?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_5
TEXT: I think that if we find Ditto, we’ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_6
TEXT: Observation will be the best way forward, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_7
TEXT: Please complete the following tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you’ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_1
TEXT: This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn’t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_2
TEXT: But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_3
TEXT: In order to make more progress, I think we should study these types of Pokémon! Can you complete the following tasks?
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_0
TEXT: Great news, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to all the data you’ve collected, I was able to make a detailed study of the differences between Electric-type Pokémon and Steel-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_1
TEXT: Thankfully, the Ditto was able to use Transform one more time! It took me some time to figure out it was attracted to all my metal equipment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_2
TEXT: Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto’s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_3
TEXT: I can now say that, according to my research, Meltan is a Steel-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_4
TEXT: I think our next step is to study more Pokémon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pokémon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_5
TEXT: {0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_6
TEXT: Oh, and one more thing—Professor Oak is also studying a Ditto in his own lab that is able to Transform into Meltan. With our parallel research, I think we’ll be able to make some breakthroughs soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_7
TEXT: By the time you complete all the research tasks, I should be able to circle back to you with the latest development.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_0
TEXT: Just in the nick of time, %PLAYERNAME%! With careful study of the Ditto that I sent him and the small amount of documented Meltan encounters, Professor Oak was able to solve more mysteries related to this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_1
TEXT: Meltan very well may have split from a Pokémon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pokémon that can divide into multiple, independent Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_2
TEXT: This explains why the world saw a simultaneous appearance of so many Ditto disguised as Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_3
TEXT: Professor Oak and I have made a guess as to how Meltan can re-form back into Melmetal—because Meltan have bodies similar to molten metal, they have a unique ability to merge and trigger an Evolution into Melmetal!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_4
TEXT: Do you know what Pokémon we should research next? You’re bright, %PLAYERNAME%, so I know you know the answer! I need you to collect data on Pokémon for which several parts can come together and act as one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_0
TEXT: Wow, I’m impressed! %PLAYERNAME%! Your data has arrived just as I’ve finished putting pieces of evidence together to learn Melmetal’s place in history.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_1
TEXT: According to these records, Melmetal was once regarded as a sacred being in a secluded community deep inside a wooded land that was rich with magnetite-bearing sedimentary rock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_2
TEXT: People there developed ways to make unique tools out of metal shed by Melmetal. Without such metal, they couldn’t have made these tools back then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_0
TEXT: I just received an important piece of news, %PLAYERNAME%! Remember the ancient text? It seems that a mysterious box was also excavated from the same site where the ancient text was found.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_1
TEXT: There was nothing in the box except a rusty lump of metal that bears interesting similarities to Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_2
TEXT: Perhaps exposing the box to this vast natural environment could cause something enigmatic to happen, resulting in Meltan changing states as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_3
TEXT: Exposing this metal to the open air could have had an entirely different effect on what’s inside the box, but we won’t know until we try it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_4
TEXT: We may be able to find a clue about the lump of metal by delving into the world of ancient Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_0
TEXT: I was right, %PLAYERNAME%! This artifact is truly Meltan! We did it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_1
TEXT: Of course, the reason for Meltan’s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pokémon somehow split itself apart.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_2
TEXT: Doing so could have been thought of as the only way for the people to ever meet Melmetal again. That warms the heart a little, doesn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_3
TEXT: Make sure you give Meltan plenty of chances to see the vast world we live in by venturing out and exploring! Who knows what will happen from here...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_1
TEXT: A Pokémon found in a jungle far to the south that was thought to have been extinct. It is so rare that many experts say that it is a myth. %BREAK%Only a few people have seen it worldwide. Apparently, it appears only to those people who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_2
TEXT: My colleagues in Kanto, including my instructor, Professor Oak, spent a long time studying Mew. It looks like our findings match theirs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_3
TEXT: According to our research, Mew was said to be observed using moves of all kinds. This observation has led some of us to say that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_2
TEXT: Yes, it looks like Mew has visited your area recently! Hmm... Interesting. If that's the case, someone should have reported a sighting...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_7_2
TEXT: My assistants and I will request some Special Research from you in the future. Stay in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again! I’m always grateful to have a helping hand with my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_1
TEXT: Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_2
TEXT: Well, I’m not entirely sure why, but Porygon have been appearing more frequently in the area as of late!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_3
TEXT: I’d like to take this opportunity to learn more about this odd Pokémon. How about it, Trainer? Will you go out and catch some Porygon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_1
TEXT: I was able to review the data you collected, and I discovered that Porygon is made entirely of programming code!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_2
TEXT: Other reports I dug up mention that it was created by a group of scientists using state-of-the-art technology. Can you believe it? A man-made Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_3
TEXT: Porygon have made a name for themselves by protecting cyberspace from suspicious activity! For something artificial, they sure do seem caring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_4
TEXT: Maybe I should keep a Porygon around in case Team GO Rocket tries a digital take-over...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_5
TEXT: Well, in the meantime, I’d like to learn more about Porygon’s evolved form, Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_6
TEXT: I have a hunch that you’ll need to use an Upgrade to evolve Porygon. Let's get back out there and see if we can't find one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts, I’ve realized just how different Porygon2 is from Porygon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_2
TEXT: According to my findings, further research and the implementation of artificial intelligence into its code allowed Porygon2 to develop the ability to learn independent of its programming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_3
TEXT: The power of science is just astounding, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_4
TEXT: These reports also mention that Porygon2 was upgraded to enable extraterrestrial exploration and planetary development, though it has yet to accomplish much.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_5
TEXT: I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_6
TEXT: For your next batch of research, I want you to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z using a Sinnoh Stone. Good luck out there, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats on evolving your Porygon2 into a Porygon-Z, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_1
TEXT: I’ve uncovered some notes about this Pokémon that I thought you’d find interesting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_2
TEXT: According to reports, an update was added to Porygon-Z’s programming that was supposed to allow it to move between dimensions. But the upgrade also caused Porygon-Z to become unstable, and it began behaving erratically.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_3
TEXT: Because the update caused instability, academics can’t seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_4
TEXT: It’s going to take a bit of time to file away all this research, but I’m thrilled we were able to learn more about Porygon and its Evolutions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_5
TEXT: Your hard work is always appreciated, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I’m in need of another inquisitive eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_0
TEXT: Hi, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m glad to see you! Can I get your help with investigating something?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_1
TEXT: I’ve noticed an alarming number of reports from Trainers who have found PokéStops that look...discolored?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_2
TEXT: Some Trainers have even spotted people wearing shirts with a big letter R on them who are guarding these PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_3
TEXT: These shady characters appear to have Pokémon with a mysterious dark aura around them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_4
TEXT: As I investigate this with Spark, it might be best to power up some of your Pokémon. You never know what we might encounter...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_0
TEXT: Great job strengthening your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_1
TEXT: After visiting one of the PokéStops with Spark, we were challenged to a Trainer Battle by someone who belongs to an organization called Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_2
TEXT: Turns out that Team GO Rocket has been stealing resources from PokéStops with the help of Pokémon that are cloaked in a dark aura. They’re called Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_3
TEXT: Luckily, we won the battle, and afterward, Team GO Rocket carelessly abandoned their defeated Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_4
TEXT: Help us protect local PokéStops from Team GO Rocket, Trainer! As you do so, please save any Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket abandons!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for all your hard work, %PLAYERNAME%! Candela and I have done some research on Shadow Pokémon and learned some very unsettling things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_1
TEXT: While Pokémon naturally become stronger through training, these Shadow Pokémon seem to have been overpowered through unnatural means.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_2
TEXT: As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_3
TEXT: But don’t worry! It looks like we can help them harness this strength through a process called purification.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_4
TEXT: Can you help me purify some Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_0
TEXT: WOW! Thanks for helping us learn more about the Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket uses, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_1
TEXT: After observing the purification process with Blanche, it’s clear that the Pokémon’s gratefulness to you for purifying them causes the move Frustration to be replaced with Return!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_2
TEXT: Now that you have this knowledge, we need your help with saving as many Shadow Pokémon as possible by taking back PokéStops that are under Team GO Rocket’s control!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_3
TEXT: The world is under attack! Can we count on you to help protect it? I do hope there’s nothing more to this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help in defeating Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been observing Team GO Rocket, and something tells us this is far from over.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_2
TEXT: The transmission sent during the Team GO Rocket take-over had a message from an unknown sender at the end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_3
TEXT: We’re going to need all the help we can get to reveal the identity of this unknown figure looming in the shadows, and you are just the Trainer for the job!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_4
TEXT: Can you help us get to the bottom of this mystery?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for your continued support against those pesky Team GO Rocket Grunts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_1
TEXT: As they flee, some Grunts are leaving behind Mysterious Components.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_2
TEXT: I believe these are what Team GO Rocket is using to hack and steal resources from PokéStops. Clever little devices, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_3
TEXT: There’s information we can glean from these components that will help us in our fight against this dangerous organization.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_4
TEXT: Once you have enough pieces, you should be able to assemble something similar to the device I’ve modified in my lab. It might be best to prepare yourself for whatever might come, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_0
TEXT: Interesting. It appears there’s more to Team GO Rocket than previously thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_1
TEXT: Their ingenuity has got me thinking there might be another use for these Mysterious Components. We shouldn’t underestimate Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_2
TEXT: It’s time to get battle ready, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_3
TEXT: I don’t want to send you out to face another foe without some more training.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_4
TEXT: While you sharpen your battle skills, I’ll be sure to get this little project of mine up and operational.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer. I’ve been working on a prototype for something I call the Rocket Radar, but I was missing some critical components.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_1
TEXT: Your hard work in retrieving these components actually made my device work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_2
TEXT: If we combine my research and these Mysterious Components you’ve found, we can create a radar-like tool to track down Team GO Rocket Hideouts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_3
TEXT: Trainers all over the world are figuring out how to put together devices like this, and they’re identifying more hideouts than I originally anticipated.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_4
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to head to these hideouts and face whatever—or whomever—is there head on. Let’s GO.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_0
TEXT: You battled well, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve done your team leaders—and me—proud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_1
TEXT: According to my observations, it appears the sender of that mysterious transmission during the Team GO Rocket take-over was not in attendance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_2
TEXT: There’s someone else calling the shots—someone above Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_3
TEXT: I’ve improved on my previous invention and put together a Super Rocket Radar that should help you track this mastermind down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_4
TEXT: If it is who I think it is, he signs all his messages with “G.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_1
TEXT: You’ve put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s plans for the time being and rescued a special Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_2
TEXT: It’s unlikely that Giovanni will give up this easily, so I hope we can rely on you to take down Team GO Rocket members as they appear around your area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_3
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela will be on the lookout as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_4
TEXT: I’m sure Team GO Rocket will try to hatch another villainous plot soon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help holding back Team GO Rocket’s forces. It’s good to know I can rely on you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_1
TEXT: However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_2
TEXT: We need to think long-term about our strategy when it comes to Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_3
TEXT: I want to make sure only the most-prepared Trainers are equipped with Super Rocket Radar devices to track Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_4
TEXT: I know you’re an accomplished Trainer, but let’s make sure your skills are keeping up with the challenge Team GO Rocket poses.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_1
TEXT: You know how purifying Shadow Pokémon makes them stronger afterward due to the gratitude they feel toward you for saving them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_2
TEXT: Maybe one of the Pokémon you purify will become a trusted partner in our efforts to fight against Team GO Rocket’s invasion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_3
TEXT: We need to continue saving and purifying these Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_0
TEXT: Fantastic! Good work purifying all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. They’re practically glowing with gratitude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_2
TEXT: One of my favorite sights is a Purified Pokémon standing proud atop a Gym controlled by its Trainer’s team. It’s truly a thing to behold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_3
TEXT: It’s time for you and your new friends to train alongside one another.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_0
TEXT: You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I are certainly proud of how much you’ve grown as a Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_2
TEXT: I have one final task for you before I can be sure your skills are keeping up with an opponent like Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_3
TEXT: If you can show me that you can still defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_4
TEXT: then I’ll know that you and your Pokémon are in top form.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_0
TEXT: Your skills are as impressive as ever. It’s time for you to take a Super Rocket Radar and see if you can track down the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I think you’re ready to take on Giovanni again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_2
TEXT: You’ve proven your strength in battle, and you’ve also shown your compassion by saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_3
TEXT: So get out there and confront Giovanni. With loyal Pokémon at your side and lots of experience under your belt, you’re unstoppable!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! You should enjoy your victory, of course, but it looks like our work isn’t done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_1
TEXT: While you were busy, I was doing some reconnaissance. I have to admit, it’s been quite thrilling!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_2
TEXT: As you might have guessed, there are many more hideouts and headquarters out there that the Team GO Rocket Leaders and Giovanni could be hiding in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_3
TEXT: We may have defeated them for the moment, but I’m sure they’ll be back and causing more trouble soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_3

TEXT: It’s time to purify more Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_4
TEXT: They have you to thank for saving them! Perhaps one of the Pokémon you saved will become an essential member of your battle team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_3
TEXT: Becoming a great Trainer is something that comes with continued practice.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_0
TEXT: All right! You make the team leaders—and me—proud, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_1
TEXT: It’s time to head out and show those Team GO Rocket Leaders that we’re strong enough to hold our own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_2
TEXT: We can’t let these bullies get in our way when we’re saving Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_0
TEXT: Fantastic work. Have you noticed, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_1
TEXT: There seems to be a trend behind which Pokémon Giovanni is turning into Shadow Pokémon. I’m thinking about the fact that he has Legendary Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_2
TEXT: Could that have anything to do with why he’s here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_3
TEXT: In any case, the time has come to track him down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_4
TEXT: The more we battle Giovanni and his team of Grunts, the more we learn about why he’s waging these take-overs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_0
TEXT: You’ve shown what it takes to be a true Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_1
TEXT: Your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, but the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_2
TEXT: Keep your eyes open, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_3
TEXT: Giovanni does not like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon, trying to further his plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_4
TEXT: I’m sure I can count on you when he returns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help battling Team GO Rocket. Trainers like you help keep Pokémon safe!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_1
TEXT: But this battle is far from over, and we must continue learning about Team GO Rocket, their leaders, and their boss, Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_2
TEXT: Looks like the Rocket Radar I developed is helping the cause. I remember when this strange activity started happening...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_3
TEXT: Back then, I had a hunch the Mysterious Components that Team GO Rocket Grunts were leaving behind held more secrets than we originally thought. We’ve come quite a long way since then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_4
TEXT: On that note, could you continue your work battling Grunts and helping Shadow Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_1
TEXT: I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pokémon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_2
TEXT: As a Pokémon Professor, I always want to contribute and help where I can. I may not be an accomplished battler like you, %PLAYERNAME%, but I can use my skills as a researcher and scientist to assist you on your journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_3
TEXT: That was why I started using Mysterious Components to build the prototype for the Rocket Radar. I hoped that Trainers like you could use it in our ongoing fight against Team GO Rocket and in our efforts to rescue more Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_4
TEXT: So let’s get out there and do just that. I’m grateful for your help, especially now. It’s when times are toughest that we have the greatest opportunity to shine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for purifying those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they are just as grateful as I am for your dedication.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_1
TEXT: Rescuing these Pokémon was the main reason for my work on the Rocket Radar prototype.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_2
TEXT: Luckily, with the help of the team leaders and motivated Trainers like you, we were able to develop a functioning Rocket Radar and even start work on the Super Rocket Radar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_3
TEXT: While a terrible situation, the Team GO Rocket invasion has been a thrilling adventure and research opportunity. I’m anxious but excited to send our findings over to my mentor, Professor Oak. I’ll be sure to let him know you said hello!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_4
TEXT: Now, it’s time to get back to work. Let’s test your battle skills, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_0
TEXT: I’m always so impressed when Trainers use supereffective moves in battle. It’s a sign of greatness when you see a Trainer using type effectiveness to their advantage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_1
TEXT: All our work lately seems to have gotten Team GO Rocket’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_2
TEXT: Reports are coming in that Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo are currently lurking in the area. You know what to do, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_0
TEXT: I knew you could do it, %PLAYERNAME%. The more you practice, the better you’ll be able to take on those pesky Team GO Rocket Leaders. I’m sure they’re already scheming up their next plan after this defeat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_1
TEXT: But now, Giovanni is waiting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_2
TEXT: Using the Super Rocket Radar, track him down and defeat him. We must remain strong—Giovanni is relentless. I wonder why he continues his invasion...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_3
TEXT: There are so many resources and Pokémon in our world. His evil plans must have something to do with that. My research will continue, but we need you to face him.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re counting on you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_1
TEXT: I will definitely be adding your victory as a note to the research I send over to Professor Oak.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_2
TEXT: I’m sure he will be interested in anything you’ve learned about Shadow Pokémon and the continuing Team GO Rocket invasion, so please keep up your research and send it my way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_3
TEXT: It may seem small, but every little bit helps!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_4
TEXT: I’ll be in touch soon, since we know Team GO Rocket isn’t likely to go anywhere. I know you’ll be ready for whatever happens next!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket’s forces.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_1
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, we’ve learned so much about this enemy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so I’m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_3
TEXT: While you’ve done an amazing job so far, I’m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_4
TEXT: The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn’t be a good Professor if I didn’t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_0
TEXT: As expected, %PLAYERNAME%. Fantastic work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_1
TEXT: Even though we’ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I’m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pokémon keep appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_2
TEXT: It seems even more Pokémon are being turned into Shadow Pokémon despite our efforts. I’ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_3
TEXT: We need to keep pushing forward—those Pokémon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_4
TEXT: I’m sure you’ll see them shine with gratitude once you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_1
TEXT: I’m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pokémon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_2
TEXT: Your talent has made it clear that you’re ready for the next step in your preparations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_3
TEXT: Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you’re at your best!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_0
TEXT: All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_1
TEXT: Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I’m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_2
TEXT: Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they’re holed up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete—you’re ready to take on Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_1
TEXT: It’s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_2
TEXT: You’ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_3
TEXT: Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won’t be able to stop you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_1
TEXT: Although your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_2
TEXT: But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_3
TEXT: Giovanni doesn’t like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon to further his plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_4
TEXT: I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I’ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_0
TEXT: Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I’ve given you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_1
TEXT: Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_2
TEXT: But there are so many aspects to Pokémon training! I think it’s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pokémon Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_3
TEXT: Why not take a walk with your buddy Pokémon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_4
TEXT: And be sure to rescue Shadow Pokémon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pokémon still need our help!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_1
TEXT: I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pokémon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche’s research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_2
TEXT: Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they’re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pokémon in danger.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_3
TEXT: While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_4
TEXT: I’m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won’t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket’s leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_1
TEXT: I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_2
TEXT: Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_3
TEXT: Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_0
TEXT: You’ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_1
TEXT: You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_2
TEXT: Great work. Now it’s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_3
TEXT: Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pokémon have certainly not gone unnoticed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_4
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket’s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_0
TEXT: Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_1
TEXT: One interesting thing to note is that I’ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pokémon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_2
TEXT: This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pokémon if they’ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_3
TEXT: There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_4
TEXT: For now, I need you to focus. It’s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_0
TEXT: What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_1
TEXT: Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I’m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_2
TEXT: You’ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn’t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_3
TEXT: But we can’t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket’s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_4
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_1
TEXT: What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_2
TEXT: We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_3
TEXT: What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_1
TEXT: As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_2
TEXT: We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_3
TEXT: More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_0
TEXT: Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_1
TEXT: I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_2
TEXT: While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_3
TEXT: It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1
TEXT: While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_2
TEXT: It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_3
TEXT: First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_4
TEXT: This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1
TEXT: I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2
TEXT: You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_3
TEXT: You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_0
TEXT: Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1
TEXT: Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_2
TEXT: This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve dropped by just in time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_1
TEXT: As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_2
TEXT: Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_3
TEXT: When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_4
TEXT: I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pokémon, and I think there’s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pokémon that is bound to a strange stone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_1
TEXT: I can’t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pokémon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pokémon, it will appear?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_2
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we’ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_1
TEXT: I can’t tell if it’s the weather, but I’ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_2
TEXT: I'll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_1
TEXT: It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2
TEXT: It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3
TEXT: Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1
TEXT: Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2
TEXT: Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0
TEXT: On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1
TEXT: Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2
TEXT: I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3
TEXT: Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0
TEXT: So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1
TEXT: Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2
TEXT: I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3
TEXT: Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!

TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2
TEXT: let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3
TEXT: I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5
TEXT: I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6
TEXT: It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7
TEXT: Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8
TEXT: Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1
TEXT: These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2
TEXT: This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0
TEXT: I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2
TEXT: I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3
TEXT: I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0
TEXT: Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1
TEXT: That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_0
TEXT: You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_2
TEXT: By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_3
TEXT: I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1
TEXT: Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2
TEXT: ...Uh, moving along...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3
TEXT: Weedle’s horn measures about two inches. It’s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate Weedle further—but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to get poked by one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0
TEXT: Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research—Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1
TEXT: It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and—in my opinion—honkable nose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2
TEXT: I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don’t think to offer me any.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s Evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0
TEXT: Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1
TEXT: Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2
TEXT: And that’s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn’t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we’ve learned so much about what’s happening to Kakuna!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it’s been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0
TEXT: Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1
TEXT: Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2
TEXT: This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pokémon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn’t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab’s tires!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_1
TEXT: I came to study Pokémon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pokémon I’ve observed today don’t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_2
TEXT: Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pokémon around, it almost feels like a safari!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_3
TEXT: Please complete the following research tasks:

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_1_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_1_1
TEXT: The results of your work have produced an awesome amount of Stardust. Perhaps you could find good use for it in powering up or trading a Pokémon! Enjoy, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_1_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_1_1
TEXT: I can tell this Dratini has the potential to become a close friend of yours! Why don’t you two take some time to get to know each other?

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_2_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_3_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_3_1
TEXT: There are many new kinds of Pokémon that have started appearing recently in the world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_3_2
TEXT: You should take a look and see if you can find anything new.

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_0
TEXT: Amazing! You found some rare Pokémon that were first discovered in the Sinnoh region already? And is that...a Shiny Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_1
TEXT: Amazing! I’ve never seen an Eevee like that before! Shiny Pokémon have a rare and distinct coloration that sets them apart from others of their species!

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_2
TEXT: Let’s commemorate this moment! Why don’t you take a snapshot and celebrate with friends?

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_5_0
TEXT: Wow, a wild Lapras sought you out?
