  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_6": "But enough of this professor’s ramblings. Eevee is known to have just one more Evolution—the Fairy-type Sylveon, which was originally discovered in the Kalos region.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_7": "This Pokémon has ribbonlike feelers that it uses to calm others. Sylveon evolves from Eevee when it reaches a certain level of friendship and trust with its beloved Trainer. Knowing that almost brings a tear to my eye!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_8": "I hope you have the good fortune of crossing paths with a wonderful Pokémon like Sylveon sometime soon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_9": "Until then, let’s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I came across a truly surprising sight recently while going for a walk—trees in the nearby forest were covered with slash marks!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_1": "I’ve heard of a Pokémon called Oshawott, the Sea Otter Pokémon, that can detach the scalchop on its stomach for use as a blade. Maybe the slash marks were caused by all of the Oshawott nearby?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_2": "Let's use this as an opportunity to go and catch some of those Oshwott so we can find out more!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_0": "Hey %PLAYERNAME%! Did you know that Oshawott doesn't just use the scalchop on its stomach to fight, but that it can be used to break open hard berries as well?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_1": "Maybe we can learn even more about Oshawott once it evolves into its next Evolution: Dewott! Don’t let its cute exterior fool you—Dewott takes itself very seriously.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_2": "Also known as the Discipline Pokémon, this little fella uses strict training to learn its flowing double-scalchop technique. I’d love to see Dewott’s fighting in action!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_0": "Wow, Dewott's double-scalchop technique is amazing! Aren’t Pokémon so curious, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_1": "I barely have the coordination to rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time and we have creatures that have their own special battle techniques. Truly inspiring stuff!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_2": "I’m starting to understand a bit more about this Pokémon now. And I have an inkling that we’ll get to learn even more soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_3": "It’s Evolution, Samurott, apparently uses swords incorporated in its armor called seamitars. Apparently in the time it takes a foe to blink, it can draw and sheathe the seamitars attached to its front legs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_4": "Sounds like it’s a true master of its craft! No wonder it’s known as the Formidable Pokémon! Let’s evolve Dewott and see this mastery for ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_0": "Well would you look at that, %PLAYERNAME%, a Samurott in the flesh! It’s seamitars truly are a sight to behold. Knowing it can draw and sheathe its blades in a blink of an eye, I wonder how fast it can dice up berries...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_1": "Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. We’ve learned so much about Oshawott, Dewott, and Samurott—and from them too! I’ll SEA you next time! Ha-ha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. A new adventure is about to begin!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_1": "Not long ago, various Legendary Pokémon began emerging from mysterious rings that suddenly appeared in the sky. After some research, we discovered it was Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon, that was responsible.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_2": "Hoopa’s rings allow it to teleport things—including itself—wherever it wants. That power makes it hard to track down, but for some reason, Hoopa seems to keep returning to this area.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_3": "How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty bold, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_4": "Luckily, he and Candela managed to retrieve my spectacles by chasing down the rings that were popping up at random around my mobile lab. So, at least I can still see. Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_5": "Needless to say, I’m still not sure why Hoopa’s here. Tracking it down has been difficult, but with your help, I’m sure we’ll crack the case in no time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_6": "For now, why don’t you try using an Incense to see what Pokémon you can find in the area?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_0": "As with all great mysteries, solving this will take time, patience, and trust. I’ll need to work alone at some points, but I promise I’ll return to share my findings and help propel us forward.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_1": "You just keep exploring the world as you always do. You never know what you might find!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_2": "I’ll report back here once I have more information on Hoopa. Thanks in advance for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3": "The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1": "I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche!",
