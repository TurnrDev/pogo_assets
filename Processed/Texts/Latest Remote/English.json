  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4": "Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?",

  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1": "Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5": "Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1": "Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_1": "You’ve really put in the time and effort to become one of the very best. Well done!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_2": "Say, do you remember when we first met? You were just a beginner back then, and I sent you off to catch your very first Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_3": "And look at you now! I’m glad we can share that memory together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_4": "Now, I’m sure an elite Trainer like yourself has mastered the art of catching Pokémon, but it’s important to keep your skills sharp.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_5": "How about you head out and catch some Pokémon? I’ve assigned some tasks that should challenge even a Trainer of your caliber.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_6": "Good luck—and have fun!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_0": "Great work as always, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_1": "I’m sure those tasks were a breeze for someone with your skills, but they were just a warm-up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_2": "These next tasks should prove a bit more challenging.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_3": "I’m sure you’ve built special bonds with several Pokémon over the course of your adventures. You might even have a few Pokémon that you like to always bring into battles.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_4": "I’d like to see how powerful those bonds are. Why don’t you head out, challenge a few Team GO Rocket Grunts, and battle in some raids?",

  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_6": "Good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_0": "How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_1": "I’m sure you had a great time working with your closest Pokémon companions.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_2": "It’s always fascinating to see how Trainers and Pokémon work together, and I can tell that you take a lot of pride in training your team. Well done!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_3": "Say, why don’t you evolve some of the Pokémon you’ve caught so they can reach their full potential? You might even discover some new options for battles.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_4": "Enough about that, though—back to our research!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_5": "This next batch will test your Pokémon-catching skills again, but with a twist. Or perhaps I should say a curve? Haha! That’s right—you’ll need to test your skills with Curveball Throws!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_6": "Make sure to stretch your throwing arm!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_0": "Nice work, Trainer! I can tell you put a lot of effort into that research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_1": "I have Blanche assisting me with the analysis and care of all those Pokémon you sent over. It’s an impressive display of your progress, Trainer, and it’s caught Blanche’s eye as well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_2": "Anyway, I should probably get back to work.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_3": "But before I go, I want to say how nice it was to reminisce about our first memories as professor and Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_4": "I’m truly proud of you and how much you’ve grown!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_5": "I know you’re far from finished on that front, too, so I’ll be watching closely as you progress and checking in whenever I have more challenges for you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_6": "Until then, %PLAYERNAME%...let’s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wanted to check in on your progress. It looks like you’ve grown even more as a Trainer since we last spoke!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_1": "As for me, I’ve been spending a lot of time with my Buddy Pokémon lately, and it’s helped me think of some new research opportunities.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_2": "Do you remember your first Buddy Pokémon? I remember mine—it was the mysterious Hex Nut Pokémon Meltan!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_3": "I still remember the day it earned its very own Best Buddy ribbon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_4": "That’s a proud moment in any Trainer’s journey, don’t you think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_5": "Meltan and I have been around the block a few times, but I still look forward to the next PokéStop we’ll visit.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_6": "Why don’t you and your buddy go out and visit some of your favorite places together?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_0": "Hope you enjoyed a few walks together with your buddy, Trainer. Did you come across any interesting PokéStops?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_1": "I was inspired to head outdoors myself. I joined Spark and his buddy for a long walk after he won a battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_2": "I even took a celebratory snapshot to mark the occasion!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_3": "Going on walks together can be a great way to strengthen your bond with your Pokémon. It’s also a wonderful form of exercise!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_4": "Seeing the bond Spark shares with his Pokémon gave me some ideas for more research. Oh, and Spark also wanted me to let you know that he’s cheering you on!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_5": "How about you and your buddy go out for a walk, challenge another Trainer and their Pokémon to battle, and take a few snapshots to capture some fun moments together?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_6": "Working hard is important, but so is savoring the memories made along the way! Have fun!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_0": "Did you make any fun memories with your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_1": "I’m always amazed by the variety in the snapshots taken by Trainers from all over the world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_2": "I’m especially fond of ones that capture surprise encounters with Pokémon like Smeargle!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_3": "That’s one of the best parts of taking snapshots—you never know what you’re going to see!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_4": "Hmm... That reminds me of when Team GO Rocket decided to start showing up in Trainers’ snapshots uninvited. And THAT reminds me of some more research I need your help with!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_5": "To start, why don’t you and your buddy get warmed up with some raids? When you’re ready, I think we’ll need some help clearing out the Team GO Rocket Leaders in the area.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_6": "They’re always up to something, so it’s good to keep an eye out in case they try to take over any nearby PokéStops. Good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_0": "Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_1": "The Team GO Rocket Leaders are a challenge for most Trainers, but I knew they wouldn’t stand a chance against you and your Buddy Pokémon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_2": "The power of friendship is strong indeed—and just one of many benefits to building relationships with your Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_3": "The trust between a Trainer and their Pokémon is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Make sure to cherish it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_4": "I’m glad I was able to check in on your progress, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_5": "I’ll be back with more fun challenges as you continue your journey.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_2": "We’ve been doing a lot of reminiscing lately, haven’t we? I think it’s important to look back on your accomplishments from time to time—especially when you’ve accomplished so much!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_3": "A major moment for many Trainers is their first victory in battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_4": "It’s an unforgettable thrill that comes with a swell of pride for the Pokémon that sealed the victory.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_6": "I’d like to focus on your battling skills for this next challenge. So to prepare, why don’t you get your team sorted and get in some throwing practice?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_0": "You clearly have some powerful Pokémon, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_1": "You’ve done an amazing job training them! I wanted to see how your battling skills have progressed, so I consulted with Candela to get her thoughts.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_2": "I’m happy to report that she’s just as proud of you as I am!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_3": "For this next challenge, she suggested taking on some of her most difficult opponents—Team GO Rocket and its leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_4": "The Team GO Rocket Leaders can be intimidating, so Candela asked me to pass along some extra guidance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_5": "She said that when it comes to battling, you should take on your opponents with a cool head, strong Pokémon, and a heart full of passion.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_6": "With that in mind, I think it’s time for you head out and put your skills to the test!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your battling skills are even more impressive than the last time we talked.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_1": "Those skills are vital not only when you take on Team GO Rocket but also when you battle in raids. Do you remember your first raid, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_2": "To me, there’s something special about a group of Trainers coming together to challenge a raid with their partner Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_3": "There’s no questioning the importance of the bonds Trainers share with their Pokémon, but I think the bonds Trainers share with their peers are equally important.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_4": "No matter your skill level, what team you’re on, or the Pokémon you bring to battle, raids are about each Trainer working together to achieve a common goal. And that’s what the Trainer community is all about!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_5": "I hope that inspired you to head out and challenge some raids with your fellow Trainers—because that’s part of your next task!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_6": "It should be a fun challenge, so be sure to give it your best shot!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_0": "Excellent work, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_1": "Did you enjoy spending time with your fellow Trainers as you completed your tasks?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_2": "Hopefully you even found a Pokémon that’ll make a great addition to your team!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_3": "I hope you continue making memories with Trainers from all over as you work together and explore this amazing world filled with Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_4": "Very few Trainers have made it as far as you have. Be sure to take a moment to celebrate your progress.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_5": "And remember—the journey is just as important as the destination!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_6": "Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_0": "I knew I’d see you here before long, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_1": "But before we begin this challenge, let’s take a couple deep breaths together, shall we?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_2": "In... And out... One more time. In... And out... There, that’s better.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_3": "A few deep breaths go a long way when you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand—and you’ll need plenty of focus for what I’ll be throwing your way next.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_4": "Get it? “Throwing”? Ahem! Anyway... The sign of a truly great Trainer is their dedication to training, and true dedication takes time to prove.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_5": "Your next few tasks will take some time to complete, but don’t worry. Start with a deep breath, and be sure to enjoy yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_6": "Training can be hard work, but don’t forget it’s supposed to be fun, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_0": "Impressive work, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_1": "I don’t know many who would have the dedication and patience to complete those tasks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_2": "Say, I was just thinking... Do you remember when you decided which team you wanted to join?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_3": "Trainers often form a strong connection to their team and become dedicated members. Others, however, eventually look to change teams in hopes of gaining a different perspective and a fresh challenge.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_4": "Everyone’s path is different, and I’ll always encourage you to find your own. There’s much to be learned from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, and Team Valor. Each team has its own unique characteristics and focus.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_5": "I urge you to learn from your fellow Trainers and respect their paths. It’s sure to help you become a better Trainer! After all, only when we understand others can we truly understand ourselves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_6": "Now, back to your research. I have a feeling this next batch will truly test your resolve, so take your time—we’ll regroup when you’re finished!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_0": "Welcome back, Trainer. You certainly showed your dedication by completing those tasks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_1": "Which did you find most difficult? And which was most fun?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_2": "We’re approaching the end of this challenge, and I’m not ashamed to say it’s making me a bit emotional! The team leaders and I feel an immense sense of pride when we see how much you’ve grown.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_3": "I hope you feel that pride in yourself, %PLAYERNAME%. To wrap up this challenge, each team leader wanted you to experience some of their most beloved activities.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_4": "Spark wants you to enjoy a walk with your buddy to enhance your bond, and Blanche hopes to remind you of the importance of research and analysis by asking you to evolve some of your Pokémon to their full potential.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_5": "As for Candela... Well, she wants to celebrate with you after you win some raids.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_6": "I think these are great tasks for a well-rounded Trainer like yourself. I’ll be here to congratulate you when you’re done!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_0": "Amazing. Simply amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! Let me be the first to congratulate you for completing this challenge. You’ve become a truly top-class Trainer, and it’s been an honor to work alongside you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_1": "It’s been astonishing to witness the growth you’ve experienced since you began your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. You’re an incredible talent, and I hope you’ll put your skills to use.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_2": "You see, I want you to help other Trainers become the best they can be. Your experience comes with a lot of responsibility, and I hope you’ll continue to show kindness, patience, and friendship to those who could benefit from your guidance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_3": "The world of Pokémon is a beautiful place, and I want you to lead by example and show everyone how amazing our community can be while protecting it from the likes of Team GO Rocket and anyone else who would threaten it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_4": "Remember how it felt the first time you caught a Pokémon, the first time you took a walk with your buddy, the first time you challenged a raid—and channel that energy into everything you do. With your strong heart and peerless determination, there’s nothing you can’t do!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_5": "I can only hope you’re as proud of yourself as the team leaders and I are of you. Don’t worry—I’ll always be here when you need me, and you can be sure I’ll be calling on you from time to time to help me with research. There’s always something more to discover, after all!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_6": "Thanks for everything, %PLAYERNAME%. I know I can always count on you! And I’m sure you know what I’m about to say, so before I get too choked up—let’s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1": "I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2": "Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3": "There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4": "I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5": "Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6": "Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1": "As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2": "My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3": "Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4": "When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5": "And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6": "As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7": "Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0": "You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1": "Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2": "Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3": "Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4": "There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5": "Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got your very own Magmortar.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_1": "Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_2": "Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_3": "Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_4": "See you around, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1": "While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs!",
