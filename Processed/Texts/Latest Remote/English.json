  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_3": "What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_4": "They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_0": "I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_1": "Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_2": "Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_3": "It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_4": "Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_5": "Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_6": "Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_1": "I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_2": "It didn’t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab’s electricity would make an excellent snack.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_3": "Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4": "Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_5": "The research would be valuable, and I’d be grateful to have my power restored!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1": "Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_2": "Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_3": "A weak electric current flows between Elekid’s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_4": "Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5": "Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1": "Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2": "Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3": "Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_4": "I can’t wait to see what electrifying facts we’ll learn about that Evolution!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_0": "I just don’t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_1": "OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2": "According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3": "When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_4": "Be careful with this Pokémon when battling with it—that’s a lot of power you’re dealing with!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5": "With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6": "Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0": "BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1": "Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2": "Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3": "Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4": "Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5": "Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6": "Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0": "Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1": "What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2": "Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3": "After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4": "The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5": "Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0": "Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2": "I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3": "There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4": "One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5": "Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6": "I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0": "Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_1": "Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2": "Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3": "All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4": "Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5": "I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Is it just me, or is a little warm here? It’s quite odd, because I was just on a walk when my surroundings became incredibly warm!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1": "I noticed there was this clearing nearby with a nice cool breeze blowing through so I came here to cool off from the sudden warmth—but then the warmth seemed to have followed me here!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2": "Curious, isn’t it? I wonder if this is the work of a Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3": "There’s one known to move frequently in hot areas and if they’re in cold areas then they’ll blow scorching flames to heat up their surroundings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4": "Regardless of whether you live in an area that’s cold or hot this time of year, I believe there are swarms of this particular Pokémon appearing more often right now.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5": "I won't tell you what I'm thinking though! I'll write it on this piece of paper and when you come back, you can check to see if my guess was right!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6": "Can you go investigate and let me know what you find?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1": "Ohoho! If you take a look at THIS paper here, you'll see that I had written down...Magmar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2": "As the kids say, my guess was on fire—AH! Wow, that little fireball was hot, it burned the paper with my guess on it to a crisp!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3": "Turns out, the Pokémon to blame for making this lovely cool area warm was indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4": "When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly—isn’t that just incredible?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5": "And to think that this incredibly intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6": "Though, field studies of this Pokémon have shown that it each and every time it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it though!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7": "Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, we’ll need to work towards evolving your Magmar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0": "You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1": "Soon, you’ll have raised yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. But watch out for the ends of their arms!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2": "According to the Pokédex, it can blast fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees F out of them. Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of the ends of your arms?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3": "Pow! Pow! Pow! That would be quite fun, don’t you say? Pow!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4": "Ah, I’m getting so fired up, I lost track of my train of thought. Get it—fired up? Ha ha ha.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5": "Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should soon be able to evolve it into a Magmortar, so keep on chugging on, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_0": "Scorching good work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve evolved and raised your very own Blast Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_1": "Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tend to live in volcanos.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_2": "Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated from shooting their 3,600 degrees F fireballs from the ends of their arms!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_3": "Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolution line has lit a fire in my heart. I think I’m going to go do some more field research with this newfound energy!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_4": "With that, I’m off. See you around, %PLAYERNAME%, and until then—let’s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_1": "Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_5": "I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_2": "As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_0": "Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_1": "However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_2": "Keep your eyes open, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_1": "What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_2": "We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_3": "What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_1": "As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_2": "We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_3": "More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_4": "Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_0": "Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_1": "I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_2": "While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_3": "It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_4": "The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_0": "Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1": "While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs! ",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_2": "It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_3": "First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_4": "This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_0": "Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1": "I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2": "You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_3": "You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_0": "Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1": "Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_2": "This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!",
