  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4": "Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?",

  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1": "Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5": "Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1": "Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2": "Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3": "Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2": "According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3": "When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5": "With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6": "Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0": "BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1": "Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2": "Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3": "Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4": "Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5": "Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6": "Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0": "Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1": "What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2": "Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3": "After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4": "The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5": "Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0": "Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2": "I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3": "There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4": "One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5": "Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6": "I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0": "Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_1": "Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2": "Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3": "All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4": "Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5": "I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1": "I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2": "Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3": "There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4": "I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5": "Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6": "Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1": "As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2": "My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3": "Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4": "When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5": "And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6": "As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7": "Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0": "You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1": "Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2": "Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3": "Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4": "There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues! ",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5": "Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
