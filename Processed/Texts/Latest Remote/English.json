  "quest_dialogue_genesect_0_2": "Suddenly I saw bright flashing lights in the near distance and went to investigate.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_0_3": "When I arrived at the site, I noticed a lot of damage to the ground and the surrounding area.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_0_4": "At first, the damage looked to be caused by Trainers practicing for the GO Battle League, but my gut told me to investigate further in the morning.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_0_5": "While I look into this, can you help me research Normal-type Pokémon? Some of the damage looks like it was caused by a Normal-type attack.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_1_0": "Thanks for getting that baseline research taken care of for me, %PLAYERNAME%. I have some updates to share with you.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_1_1": "After I returned to the site we’re studying, I realized there was actually a trail of damage.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_1_2": "When I followed that trail, I started finding areas that were clearly burned.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_1_3": "That damage must have been done by a Fire-type Pokémon—or at least a Pokémon that knows Fire-type attacks.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_1_4": "You know what this means, Trainer! Time to research Fire-type Pokémon.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_1_5": "The more information we have about this type of Pokémon, the more clues we’ll have to determine whatever did all this damage.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_1_6": "Meanwhile, I’ll continue following the trail of damage.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_2_0": "Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You’re on fire?",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_2_1": "Anyway...the damage can’t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_2_2": "Could it really have been caused by Pokémon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pokémon for me?",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_2_3": "As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn’t seem to line up with any Pokémon I’ve encountered.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, I’m so glad you’re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_1": "I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_2": "She shared some notes about a Mythical Pokémon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_3": "Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pokémon is Bug and Steel type, it’s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_4": "This lines up with the damage at the site we’ve been researching!",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5": "One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_6": "I’ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pokémon to help us get to the bottom of this.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_0": "I can’t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_1": "With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we’ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon Genesect!",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_2": "I know what you’re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3": "Apparently, when this Pokémon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pokémon’s holding.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_4": "I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pokémon.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_5": "I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pokémon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_6": "You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!",
  "quest_send_gifts_singular": "Send a Gift to a friend",
  "quest_snapshot_genesect": "Take {0} snapshots of Genesect",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_0_0": "Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_0_1": "Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra’s ability to teleport.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_0_2": "When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it’s made copies of itself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_0_3": "However, what’s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let’s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pokémon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_1_0": "Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_1_1": "It’s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_1_2": "Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_1_3": "I’ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I’ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_2_0": "I’m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I’m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_2_1": "While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it’s sleeping! What amazing abilities!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_2_2": "Why don’t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I’ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I’ve developed.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_2_3": "While it won’t give you Abra’s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_3_0": "Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_3_1": "We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pokémon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_3_2": "Pokémon are truly amazing creatures. There’s always something to discover.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_3_3": "Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket’s forces.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_1": "Thanks to your hard work, we’ve learned so much about this enemy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_2": "Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so I’m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_3": "While you’ve done an amazing job so far, I’m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_4": "The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn’t be a good Professor if I didn’t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_1": "Even though we’ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I’m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pokémon keep appearing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_2": "It seems even more Pokémon are being turned into Shadow Pokémon despite our efforts. I’ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_0": "Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_1": "I’m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pokémon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_2": "Your talent has made it clear that you’re ready for the next step in your preparations.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_3": "Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you’re at your best!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_0": "All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_1": "Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I’m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_2": "Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they’re holed up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete—you’re ready to take on Giovanni.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_1": "It’s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_2": "You’ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_3": "Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won’t be able to stop you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_1": "Although your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_2": "But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_3": "Giovanni doesn’t like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon to further his plans.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_4": "I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I’ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_0": "Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I’ve given you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_1": "Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_2": "But there are so many aspects to Pokémon training! I think it’s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pokémon Eggs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_3": "Why not take a walk with your buddy Pokémon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_4": "And be sure to rescue Shadow Pokémon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pokémon still need our help!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_1": "I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pokémon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche’s research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_2": "Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they’re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pokémon in danger.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_3": "While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_4": "I’m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won’t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket’s leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_0": "Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_1": "I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_2": "Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes! ",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_3": "Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_0": "You’ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_1": "You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_2": "Great work. Now it’s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_3": "Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pokémon have certainly not gone unnoticed.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_4": "I’ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket’s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_0": "Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_1": "One interesting thing to note is that I’ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pokémon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_2": "This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pokémon if they’ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pokémon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_3": "There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_4": "For now, I need you to focus. It’s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_0": "What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_1": "Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I’m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_2": "You’ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn’t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_3": "But we can’t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket’s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.",
